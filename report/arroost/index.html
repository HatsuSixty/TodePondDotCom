<h2>Creative work</h2>

<p>
  In my opinion, <strong>creative work</strong> is when you use your imagination
  to "make something". This can include performing a song, writing a book,
  painting a picture, drawing a diagram, baking a cake, giving a speech,
  designing a game, or coding a program.
</p>

<!-- <p>
  For ease and simplicity, this essay will focus only on
  <strong>making pictures</strong> and <strong>making music</strong>.
</p> -->

<!-- <p>
  Some people might disagree with me. They might say that "coding a program"
  isn't <strong>creative work</strong>, or one of my other examples isn't
  <strong>creative work</strong>. They might say that I'm being too loose with
  my definition, and that's okay. We don't need to agree on that for the
  purposes of this essay. I'm going to stick to examples that are about
  <strong>making pictures</strong> and <strong>making music</strong> because
  they're easy to talk about.
</p>

<p>
  But if you <em>do</em> agree with me on those other examples being creative
  work, then you can imagine that I'm talking about any of them, any time I say
  <strong>creative work</strong>.
</p> -->

<h2>Blockers</h2>

<p>
  In any creative work, the person doing the work might experience
  <strong>blockers</strong> that stop them from continuing. Let's think about
  what those blockers could be. Here are some examples.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>"Oh no! I ran out of paint."</li>
  <li>"I don't know how to use this programming language."</li>
  <li>"I feel too nervous to go up on stage."</li>
  <li>"I can't visualise what I want to make."</li>
  <li>"I suck at drawing. It'll look stupid if I try."</li>
  <li>"There's too much pressure on me to be good."</li>
  <li>"It's not producing the thing I want and I don't know why."</li>
  <li>"I've ran out of ideas."</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm sure you could think of some more examples of your own.</p>

<h2>Emotional versus intellectual</h2>

<p>
  We could categorise all of these potential <strong>blockers</strong> into one
  of two categories:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Intellectual blockers</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Emotional blockers</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>
  <strong>Intellectual blockers</strong> are when you don't know how to solve a
  problem, or create what you intend, even if you know exactly what you want.
  You might not know how to use a tool, or you may not have the right materials.
  Your tool might be insufficient! Your paint bucket was too small, or your
  coding tool was too limited. Or your programming environment doesn't give you
  enough realtime feedback, so you have no chance of understanding how it works.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Emotional blockers</strong> are when you have the tools and materials
  and skills that you need, but you're feeling too nervous, or too scared, or
  too embarrassed, or too distracted.
</p>

<p>Let's organise our example blockers into a table.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Intellectual blockers</th>
      <th>Emotional blockers</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        "Oh no! I ran out of paint."<br />
        "I don't know how to use this programming language."<br />
        "I can't visualise what I want to make."<br />
        "It's not producing the thing I want and I don't know why."
      </td>
      <td>
        "I feel too nervous to go up on stage."<br />
        "I suck at drawing. It'll look stupid if I try."<br />
        "There's too much pressure on me to be good."<br />
        "I've ran out of ideas."
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Live programming</h2>

<p>
  <strong>Live programming</strong> has often been paired with
  <strong>creative work</strong>, the current canonical examples being
  <a href="https://worrydream.com/">Bret Victor</a>'s
  <a href="https://vimeo.com/906418692">Inventing On Principle</a> and
  <a href="https://vimeo.com/64895205">Dead Fish</a> talks.
</p>

  <figcaption>Getting immediate feedback in Inventing On Principle.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  And <a>Ink & Switch</a> continues work in that vein, with
  <strong>live programming</strong> projects like
  <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/untangle/">Untangle</a> being used for
  generative art.
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="untangle.jpeg" />

</figure>

<p>
  Of course, it goes without saying that
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QY2x6aZzqc">live coding itself</a>
  combines <strong>live programming</strong> with
  <strong>creative work</strong>. And
  <a href="https://slab.org/">Alex McLean</a>'s
  <a href="https://algorave.com/">Algorave</a> continues to foster an
  international community of live coders.
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="strudel.png" />
  <figcaption>
    You can see what is firing in <a href="https://strudel.cc/">Strudel</a>.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  Personally, I can guess why the two have been paired up â€” they're a great fit
  for each other. <strong>Live programming</strong>'s immediate feedback
  encourages exploration and play. This allows the coder to discover new
  possibilities, and to <em>feel</em> their way through the tool. And the
  emphasis on tangible representation of code allows the coder to directly
  manipulate their work, and visualise what is going on. They can
  <em>see it</em>.
</p>

<h2>Tools for thought</h2>

<p>
  I see the value and power of <strong>live programming</strong>. I can see how
  it removes creative <strong>blockers</strong>. However, I personally feel that
  there is still far more to explore in terms of removing
  <strong>emotional blockers</strong>. I think there is a lot of untapped
  potential there (which I will now try to show you).
</p>

<p>
  We work alongside the <strong>tools for thought</strong> space, where interest
  is around supporting the user's thoughts, enabling them to use the computer as
  an extension of their brain. And there is the ever-cited "bicycle of the mind"
  metaphor.
</p>

<p>
  In my opinion, the goal of these kinds tools is to remove
  <strong>intellectual blockers</strong>. They acknowledge that our brain has
  limits, and they seek to support it.
</p>

<p>
  If that is true, we could also conceive of a set of tools that help us to
  overcome <strong>emotional blockers</strong>. We should acknowledge that our
  emotions have limits, and we can use computers to help support them. Perhaps
  we could call it... <strong>tools for feeling</strong>... no that's too
  cheesy... how about... <strong>bicycle for the heart</strong>... no I don't
  like that either.
</p>

</h1>

<p>
  It turns out, there <em>are</em> many tools out there that try to remove
  <strong>emotional blockers</strong>. We can learn from them when making our
  <strong>live programming</strong> tools.
</p>

<h2>tldraw</h2>

<p>
  <a href="https://tldraw.com">tldraw</a> is a whiteboard tool and library. It's
  interesting because it's all very wobbly. Whenever you draw, or write, or make
  shapes, all of your marks are imperfect. Everything looks slightly wonky and
  scrappy.
</p>

<p>
  This wonkiness is intentional. tldraw makes it difficult to line up your work
  perfectly. It's so hard that it stops you trying, and you carry on drawing and
  writing instead.
</p>

<h2>Sandspiel</h2>

<p>
  <a href="https://sandspiel.club">Sandspiel</a> is a video game that simulates
  different elements on a pixel by pixel basis. Elements like sand, water, fire,
  and magic dust, all behave differently and interact together in combinatorial
  ways. This kind of game is known as a
  <a href="https://maxbittker.com/making-sandspiel/">falling sand game</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The unusual thing about Sandspiel is that most users don't use it as a falling
  sand game. They use it as a drawing tool instead.
  <em>Why would they do that?</em>
</p>

<p>
  Why would anyone <em>draw</em> in a <strong>falling sand game</strong> and not
  an actual drawing tool like Photoshop or Procreate or Pixlr, or even Microsoft
  Paint, or even just on a physical piece of paper? Sandspiel wasn't
  (originally) designed for drawing, so it seems like an odd choice at first.
</p>
<p>
  But the occasional commenter explains why: They've already tried those "real"
  drawing tools, and it goes badly. They can't handle the pressure of the blank
  canvas, and the expectation to make something good. But in Sandspiel, they
  feel free to draw to their heart's content. And they feel free to share their
  work with the world.
</p>
<p>
  And there's also some warmup time. When you enter Sandspiel, you have
  something to play with. You can place down elements, and interact with the
  game while you're deciding what to draw. You might get inspiration from the
  game itself.
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="sandspiel.png" />
  <figcaption>
    Sandspiel isn't a drawing tool but people use it as one.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  <a href="https://studio.sandspiel.club">Sandspiel Studio</a> is a
  <strong>live programming</strong> tool that I worked on. It's an
  end-user-programmable version of Sandspiel. Users can use its block-based code
  editor to change how the elements behave and look.
</p>
<p>
  We tried to lean into the same strengths that Sandspiel has. It doesn't start
  you off with a blank canvas. You start with the existing elements, and you can
  begin by editing them, and playing around. You're not forced to start from
  scratch (like in <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>), which is
  much more daunting. The goal of this is to stop the users feeling afraid. The
  goal is to remove <strong>emotional blockers</strong>. They can take their
  time to get familiar with the system, before jumping in.
</p>

<h2>Algorave</h2>

<p>
  <a href="Algorave">Algorave</a> is a practice where someone
  <strong>live codes</strong> visuals and music, and a crowd dances to it, in
  response.
</p>

<p>
  This puts the <strong>live coder</strong> in a vulnerable position because
  there is a certain amount of pressure involved. If they make a mistake, it
  could affect the whole crowd.
</p>

<p>
  However, the fact that it's being done <strong>live</strong> as a performance,
  means that the expectations are adjusted. People can meaningfully expect that
  there <em>will</em> be some mistakes, and that is actually part of the fun.
  There is a culture of <a href="">embracing the mistake</a> within
  <strong>live coding</strong> and Algorave, and that removes
  <strong>emotional blockers</strong> around failure.
</p>

<h2>Toshio Iwai</h2>

<p>
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/t8cI6GlyKqk?si=mxfCmWDIN10ginxP">
    Toshio Iwai</a
  >
  is an artist who has developed various <strong>live programming</strong> tools
  for making music. These include
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_Fantasy">Sound Fantasy</a> and
  the more widely known
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28UDxIQiaIY">Electroplankton</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Both tools provide the user with puzzle-like musical instruments. But using
  them feels less like playing an instrument, and more like playing a game, or
  interacting with an environment. As the music-maker, it feels like you take a
  secondary role, as you try to influence the simulation to produce sounds of
  different types. It is the tool making those sounds, not you, and it can take
  the responsibility if it doesn't sound pleasant. There is no pressure on the
  user. There are no <strong>emotional blockers</strong>.

<h2>Hopes</h2>

todo: i hope to start a conversation about emotional blockers. arroost is just
one example of how we might do that, and it's not very good really. it's a
"burger king" suggestion, to kick off the conversation. my hope is that people
will start to use the "emotional blocker" angle as a way of critiquing all tools
and projects out there.

<h2>"Feeling good" is not enough</h2>

todo: just because your tool "feels good" to use, it doesnt mean that's a
helpful feeling. in fact, that can make it worse!

<h2>Live coding is right there</h2>

todo: we should learn from the live coding community
