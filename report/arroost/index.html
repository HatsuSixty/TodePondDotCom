<h2>Creative work</h2>

<p>
  In my opinion, <strong>creative work</strong> is when you use your imagination
  to "make something". This can include performing a song, writing a book,
  painting a picture, drawing a diagram, baking a cake, giving a speech,
  designing a game, or coding a program.
</p>

<!-- <p>
  For ease and simplicity, this essay will focus only on
  <strong>making pictures</strong> and <strong>making music</strong>.
</p> -->

<!-- <p>
  Some people might disagree with me. They might say that "coding a program"
  isn't <strong>creative work</strong>, or one of my other examples isn't
  <strong>creative work</strong>. They might say that I'm being too loose with
  my definition, and that's okay. We don't need to agree on that for the
  purposes of this essay. I'm going to stick to examples that are about
  <strong>making pictures</strong> and <strong>making music</strong> because
  they're easy to talk about.
</p>

<p>
  But if you <em>do</em> agree with me on those other examples being creative
  work, then you can imagine that I'm talking about any of them, any time I say
  <strong>creative work</strong>.
</p> -->

<h2>Blockers</h2>

<p>
  In any creative work, the person doing the work might experience
  <strong>blockers</strong> that stop them from continuing. Let's think about
  what those blockers could be. Here are some examples.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>"Oh no! I ran out of paint."</li>
  <li>"I don't know how to use this programming language."</li>
  <li>"I feel too nervous to go up on stage."</li>
  <li>"I can't visualize what I want to make."</li>
  <li>"I suck at drawing. It'll look stupid if I try."</li>
  <li>"There's too much pressure on me to be good."</li>
  <li>"It's not producing the thing I want and I don't know why."</li>
  <li>"I've ran out of ideas."</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm sure you could think of some more examples of your own.</p>

<h2>Emotional versus intellectual</h2>

<p>
  We could categorise all of these potential <strong>blockers</strong> into one
  of two categories:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Intellectual blockers</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Emotional blockers</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>
  <strong>Intellectual blockers</strong> are when you don't know how to solve a
  problem, or create what you intend, even if you know exactly what you want.
  You might not know how to use a tool, or you may not have the right materials.
  Your tool might be insufficient! Your paint bucket was too small, or your
  coding tool was too limited. Or your programming environment doesn't give you
  enough realtime feedback, so you have no chance of understanding how it works.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Emotional blockers</strong> are when you have the tools and materials
  and skills that you need, but you're feeling too nervous, or too scared, or
  too embarrassed, or too distracted.
</p>

<p>Let's organize our example blockers into a table.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Intellectual blockers</th>
      <th>Emotional blockers</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        "Oh no! I ran out of paint."<br />
        "I don't know how to use this programming language."<br />
        "I can't visualize what I want to make."<br />
        "It's not producing the thing I want and I don't know why."
      </td>
      <td>
        "I feel too nervous to go up on stage."<br />
        "I suck at drawing. It'll look stupid if I try."<br />
        "There's too much pressure on me to be good."<br />
        "I've ran out of ideas."
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Live programming</h2>

<p>
  <strong>Live programming</strong> has often been paired with creative work.
  From <a href="https://worrydream.com/">Bret Victor</a>'s
  <a href="https://vimeo.com/906418692">Inventing on Principle</a>, to
  <a href="https://slab.org/">Alex McLean</a>'s
  <a href="https://algorave.com/">Algorave</a>, it's a widely explored
  combination.
</p>

<p>
  And it's clear why the two have been paired up â€” they're a good fit for each
  other. Live programming's emphasis on immediate feedback encourages
  exploration and play.
</p>

<p>
  todo: but most live programming tools are focused on intellectual blockers...
  tools for THOUGHT. what about a tool for FEELING?
</p>

<h2>Tools for feeling</h2>

todo: could we create something that helps with emotional blockers?<br />
todo: we have enough people making tools for thought, but what about tools for
feeling?<br />
todo: bicycle of the mind? what about a bicycle of the heart?<br />

</h1>

todo: well, actually, yes. lots of tools already do this, and we should pay more
attention to them in the live programming research world

<h2>Hopes</h2>

todo: i hope to start a conversation about emotional blockers. arroost is just
one example of how we might do that, and it's not very good really. it's a
"burger king" suggestion, to kick off the conversation. my hope is that people
will start to use the "emotional blocker" angle as a way of critiquing all tools
and projects out there.

<h2>"Feeling good" is not enough</h2>

todo: just because your tool "feels good" to use, it doesnt mean that's a
helpful feeling. in fact, that can make it worse!

<h2>Live coding is right there</h2>

todo: we should learn from the live coding community
