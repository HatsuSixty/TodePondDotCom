this page is a record of my 'lab notes' while research-in-residencing at ink & switch

# INTRODUCTION

hello everyone i'm planning to use this channel as a place to explore two kinds of things:

- figuring out how to **PRESENT & COMMUNICATE** projects that I've already made<br>
  (eg: arroost, cellpond)
- figuring out how to **DESIGN & IMPLEMENT** things i haven't made yet<br>
  (eg: fractal bucket, see-through computer, advanced arroost, edgepond)

feel free to join or chuck in any questions / thoughts / feelings / whatever at any point

# ARROOST DEMO

thanks for taking part in my demo today everyone! and for all your insights. i will digest them and maybe write them up

I invite you to explore:

- the [examples](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/arroost/examples/)
- this [blog post](https://edibotopic.com/blog/doing/leisure-sick/) by an arroost user. they talk about how it helped them "become unlocked".
- perhaps the [weirdest talk](https://youtu.be/cF2OF75ivZM) I've ever given, introducing arroost.
- [arroost itself](https://arroost.com)! it's a bit of a puzzle box, but you might be able to work your way in.

# PLAY

during the demo, the topic of **play** was discussed.

It made me realise the different kinds of play out there:

- play as in exploration.
- play as in performing something.
- play as in playing a game, competitive or otherwise.

The type of play I have in mind is EXPLORATIVE PLAY.<br>
I hadn't considered the other types. Probably because I come from a teaching background.<br>
This is something I will try to get across in any future talk or demo!
