Ohhhhhh yes. It's time again... for the weekly...

🐸 TODEPOND PONDCAST 🐸

What's new this week?

## Time travel

I planned out the [Arrows] video in the year 2021.

It was shortly after the [Time Travel] video dropped. And my head was full of ideas on how to implement time travel in a better way.

> It was also a big time for me personally, deciding to leave my job, and changing my name, and so on.

"Music's a perfect analogy!" I thought. "Music is so closely linked to time. It's the perfect vessel for exploring time travel."

But how do I demonstrate *sound* in a video? My videos already have tons of loud music playing in the background. It would all clash.

My first draft of the script was built around a quieter trance tune, [There Is Peace Beyond] and its [remix]. Arroost's noises would complement the tracks, landing in-time and in-tune with the music.

I still feel attached to that first version of the video. But I decided that it would be too hard. It would be easier... to just...

## Make it all myself

I eventually decided to make all the music myself. (Except from a track called [Nara] in the intro and ending).

Over the following 24 months, I tried and tried and tried to come up with some simple sounds that I could use as background music. I needed it to be:

- Simple enough to make in arroost.
- Slightly catchy at points, with some recognisable repeating sections.
- Slightly melancholy with a touch of hope. I wanted it to feel like you were stuck in the middle of doing something, that took a very very long time.
- Scrappy, and rough around the edges (this one was easy).

In my spare time, I record lots and lots and lots of little tunes that I play on various instruments. The main reason I record them is so that I don't forget any tunes that I accidentally come up with. I give my favourites a little name in my recorder app, so that I can find them again one day.

I found one that I recorded on christmas eve in 2019, named...

## Up and on the highway

Please excuse the grating whistling. It was trying to jot down this tune in any way I could, so that I wouldn't forget it.

When I found it two years later, I liked how it was a bit jolly, and a bit melancholy. I call it... melanjolly.

I also liked how annoying it sounded. So it eventually became...
