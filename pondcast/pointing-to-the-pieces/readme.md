Ohhhhhh yes. It's time again... for the weekly...

🐸 TODEPOND PONDCAST 🐸

What's new this week?

## Time travel

I planned out the [Arrows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNBKdU6XrLY) video in the year 2021.

It was shortly after the [Time Travel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z24NKn6rQRY) video dropped. And my head was full of ideas on how to implement time travel in a better way.

> It was also a big time for me personally, deciding to leave my job, and changing my name, and so on.

"Music's a perfect analogy!" I thought. "Music is so closely linked to time. It's the perfect vessel for exploring time travel."

But how do I demonstrate *sound* in a video? My videos already have tons of loud music playing in the background. It would all clash.

My first draft of the script was built around a quieter trance tune, [There Is Peace Beyond](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noZ2jXz35vA) and its [remix]. Arroost's noises would complement the tracks, landing in-time and in-tune with the music.

I still feel attached to that first version of the video. But I decided that it would be too hard. It would be easier... to just...

## Make it all myself

I eventually decided to make all the music myself. (Except for a track called [Nara](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXiwC4tcYmA) in the intro and ending).

<div class="video-container" style="height: 200px">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PXiwC4tcYmA?si=vOSjEv7iYCKJdtNd" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Over the following 24 months, I tried and tried and tried to come up with some simple sounds that I could use as background music. I needed it to be:

- Simple enough to make in arroost.
- Slightly catchy at points, with some recognisable repeating sections.
- Slightly melancholy with a touch of hope. I wanted it to feel like you were stuck in the middle of doing something, that took a very very long time.
- Scrappy, and rough around the edges (this one was easy).

In my spare time, I record lots and lots and lots of little tunes that I play on various instruments. The main reason I record them is so that I don't forget any tunes that I accidentally come up with. I give my favourites a little name in my recorder app, so that I can find them again one day.

I found one that I recorded on christmas eve in 2019, named...

## Up and on the highway

  <source src="up-and-on-the-highway.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Please excuse the grating whistling. I was trying to jot down this tune in any way I could, so that I wouldn't forget it.

When I found it two years later, I liked how it was a bit jolly, and a bit melancholy. I call it... melanjolly.

I also liked how annoying it sounded. So it eventually became...

## Arrow in an arrow

<video controls>
  <source src="arrow-in-an-arrow.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

In my head, I knew I wanted to end up on this song. "Arrow in an arrow" swirled around my head for the following 9 months. It started to drive me a bit crazy. And my colleagues too, as I couldn't stop humming it. It was the recurring tune that guided the rest of the music.

In the video, I used it in the coming out sequence.

## I will be here for too long

Next, I tried to find some phrases that could lead into "arrow in an arrow". I started 

## Taking too long

## How much longer

## Take it back again
