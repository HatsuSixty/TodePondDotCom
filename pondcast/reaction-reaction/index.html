    TODEPOND PONDCAST: Reaction reaction
  </h1>

  <p>Oh my god. It&#39;s time for‚Äî</p>
  <p>It&#39;s been a weird week. Thank god it&#39;s the‚Äî</p>
  <p>üê∏ TODEPOND PONDCAST üê∏</p>
  <p>What&#39;s new this week?</p>
  <img src="1.png" />
  <h2 id="reaction-reaction">Reaction reaction</h2>
  <p>
    I did a livestream a week ago. Its premise was simple. I would react to‚Äî
  </p>
  <p>
    Ok, a long time ago, I released a video called
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvlsJ3FqNYU">Spellular Automata</a
    >. And recently, a tech influencer called
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@t3dotgg">Theo</a> made a
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jX84iTXKg8">reaction video</a>
    about it. So I decided to make a reaction video of his reaction video, and I
    decided to record it live, on
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/hlsDbXSZ2ko">a livestream</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    But there was a twist. After doing my reaction video, which took about an
    hour, I then did another reaction video of reaction video of Theo&#39;s
    reaction video of my video. And that took about an hour as well. And then, I
    did it again. I did a reaction video of my reaction video of my reaction
    video of Theo&#39;s reaction video of my video. And that took about another
    hour. And this might seem crazy. Maybe it is.
  </p>
  <p>
    During this whole time, many many people were watching. It was always over
    one hundred people, which was absolutely crazy for me. I couldn&#39;t
    believe it when this was all going on. I still can&#39;t, to be honest. It
    was this incredible a d special community moment, where we all got to
    interact in realtime. And if you missed it, you can still
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/hlsDbXSZ2ko">catch up</a>, and see all
    the chat messages along the way.
  </p>
  <p>
    After a while, some viewers recommended that I speed up the video. This was
    partly to make it quicker, but also partly so that I could
    <em>catch up</em> to the present, and swallow myself. By the end, I was
    reacting to what I had done just one second ago.
  </p>
  <p>
    The whole stream was perhaps the most surreal experience I&#39;ve ever
    experienced in my entire life. It feels like it left a lasting impression on
    me. I can&#39;t quite put into words yet.
  </p>
  <p>
    Watch the whole stream
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/hlsDbXSZ2ko">here</a> and/or watch
    this
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54cK-XLu-s0">compilation</a> of one
    of the hundreds of threaded storylines.
  </p>
  <img src="2.png" />
  <h2 id="swallowing-myself">Swallowing myself</h2>
  <p>I gave a talk about <a href="https://screenpond.cool">ScreenPond</a>!</p>
  <p>
    I&#39;ve demoed ScreenPond over-the-shoulder many many many times before.
    It&#39;s maybe my most frequently done demo because it gets into the goods
    very quickly. And of course I made that
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4OIcwt8vcE">video</a>. But
    it&#39;s one of the few &#39;main&#39; projects that I&#39;ve never
    presented in front of an audience.
  </p>
  <p>
    So I tried to figure out how to present it‚Äî how to tell its story. For
    ScreenPond, I needed the talk itself to match the madness of the infinite
    space warping recursion that the engine does. So I included a few
    &#39;fakeouts&#39; where you thought the talk was going to be one thing, but
    then it ended up being something else. The talk ended up jumping between
    four different &#39;environments&#39;. It was like it was switching between
    four different talks.
  </p>
  <p>
    As time went on, the talk became more and more chaotic, and it all sort of
    mushed into one. Essentially, the talk was about feeling overwhelmed, and
    trying to represent that feeling with code.
  </p>
  <p>
    It went down really well, and I regret not asking anyone to film it. I did
    see people film some sections of it, but I&#39;ve only been sent a couple of
    short clips so far.
  </p>
  <img src="3.png" />
  <h2 id="dialogues">Dialogues</h2>
  <p>
    Perhaps one of the reasons I&#39;ve been losing my mind recently is that
    I&#39;ve been trying and struggling, but soldiering on, to work on the essay
    that [Dave Ackley] and I are doing together. It probably explains why the
    livestream was so bonkers.
  </p>
  <p>
    And hey, Dave covered it in
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreRFxN6wuM"
      ><em>his</em> update</a
    >
    this week too.
  </p>
  <p>
    It feels really hard to &#39;edit&#39; a dialogue. In one sense, it feels
    disingenuous. The essay is presented as a dialogue of speech, but then
    we&#39;re editing it. On the other hand, it&#39;s enjoyably meta. The essay
    is presented as a dialogue, because that&#39;s what the essay is about. So
    we now get the chance to &#39;work on our natural code&#39;.
  </p>
  <p>
    I&#39;m determined to get it done, and get it done well. At least I&#39;ll
    try. I&#39;ll give it my <em>best effort</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong
      >I want to thank you for supporting my work for another week. Welcome to
      everyone who joined this week. There are loads of you! The livestream
      really did make a big difference, it seems. So, welcome. And welcome back
      to all the old-timers, who have stuck with me for so long. I thank you
      from the bottom of my heart. Wherever you are in the world, whatever
      you&#39;re doing... I hope you have a great week.</strong
