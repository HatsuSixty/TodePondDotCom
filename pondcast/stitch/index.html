    TODEPOND PONDCAST: Stitch
  </h1>

  <p>Hello, it's me. And this is yet another weekly episode of the...</p>

  <p>🐸 TODEPOND PONDCAST 🐸</p>

  <p>What's new this week?</p>

  <h2>Stitch</h2>

  <p>
    This week, I’ve been working on the first exhibition for
    <a href="https://tornleaf.gallery">Torn Leaf</a>, my silly online gallery.
    The submissions have been truly wonderful. There’s a nice mix now, but
    there’s still room for some last minute entries. Submit now, or later, if
    you want to get involved.
  </p>

  <p>
    My job has been deciding how to order the different pieces of the
    exhibition. I’m picking what goes first, and what goes last, and which ones
    to group together. It’s been really nice to think through what goes with
    what, and what clashes in an enjoyable way. I’m trying to make every piece
    shine and sing for what it is.
  </p>

  <p>
    In preparation for the exhibition, I’ve been setting up and testing some
    infrastructure for being able to stream long videos — some of the pieces are
    quite long, and can be played on a loop. Some videos are locked to the
    global time, so that every visitor is watching the same part at the same
    time. Some videos can be played manually, and should be watched from start
    to finish. And of course, many submissions are not videos themselves — some
    are image-based, some are coded, and one piece is a single very very short
    sound.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m also setting it up so that… if you click a submitter’s photo (ie: their
    face), then they <em>talk</em> to you. It’ll play their pre-recorded
    message.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am slightly feeling the pressure to make this into something good, but I’m
    liking the feeling of where it’s going. And I want to get the ball rolling
    on Torn Leaf… to lead the way into further exhibitions, where I hope I can
    get more people involved in the organising of it.
  </p>

  <h2>Seet or Arroost</h2>

  <p>
    I’ve been writing more of my Seet write-up (it’s a bit of research I did on
    being able to see the program that you’re coding). However… I’ve paused work
    on it. It’s more important that I work on my
    <a href="https://arroost.com">Arroost</a> submission for
    <a href="https://2024.splashcon.org/home/live-2024">LIVE / SPLASH</a>, and I
    don’t want to rush out the Seet stuff. It’s worth doing properly, I think.
  </p>

  <p>
    Besides, it’s been long enough since I started work on Arroost now. I’ve
    been riffing on the submission title a little bit… It’s gone through various
    iterations like “Creativity The Hard Way”, “The Long Way”, “Creating
    Creativity”, “Unblocking Creativity” and I like none of them. They’re all
    really cheesy, and don’t really capture any intrigue. I did have “Normalise
    Sharing Scrappy Fiddles” but that’s more suitable for an artistic
    presentation of Arroost, and I
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF2OF75ivZM">already did that</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’ve been trying to figure out what order to present things in (in the
    submission). I want to give the historical context of musical tools, and the
    creative tools out there that inspired me. And I do need to show how it’s
    all linked to live programming, because that’s what the conference is
    actually about. To me, it clearly is, but sometimes are people funny with
    creative tools. Because they’re boring.
  </p>

  <h2>Miniature Lab</h2>

  <p>
    I’m also devising my presentation about the
    <a href="https://tadiweb.com">tadi web</a>, which will demonstrate some of
    my <a href="https://todepond.com/lab">lab experiments</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Again, I’m figuring out how to introduce the project— how to explain the
    tadi web, which has so far just been an odd thing that I sometimes talk
    about on <a href="https://mas.to/@TodePond">mastodon</a>. But in this case,
    I think it’s ok to keep it simple and mysterious. I think that I can just
    show the demos, and let people wonder what it’s all about, similar to the
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF2OF75ivZM"
      >Normalise Sharing Scrappy Fiddles</a
    >
    presentation.
  </p>

  <p>
    I think the most entertaining parts of the demo could be the
    <a href="https://todepond.com/lab/tool">Tool</a> one and the
    <a href="https://todepond.com/lab/polar">Polar</a> one and also the
    <a href="https://drawdeadfish.com">Fish</a> one. And I think they could
    contrast quite well with some of the more texty ones, including the recent
    <a href="https://todepond.com/lab/locker">Locker</a> and
    <a href="https://todepond.com/lab/leave">Leave</a> experiments, which saw
    quite a lot of users!
  </p>

  <h2>Magritte</h2>

  <p>
    I gave a mini art history lesson in the middle of most recent
    <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/071">Elephant episode</a> of
    the
    <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/">future of code podcast</a>.
    This week, I’ve been converting it into video format, adding images, and
    symbols, and stuff… to match the audio. I think it’ll turn into a fun
    mini-bonus-episode, and I hope it can get put on the future of coding
    youtube channel or something.
  </p>

  <h2>Conditional</h2>

  <p>
    Our
    <a
      href="https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/academia/natural-code/submitted/"
      >submission</a
    >
    for
    <a href="https://2024.splashcon.org/track/splash-2024-Onward-Essays"
      >Onward Essays</a
    >
    got CONDITIONALLY ACCEPTED, which is really nice. As always with my work,
    feedback was mixed, and none of the reviewers really understood it. They did
    all say that they enjoyed reading it, and it even kept one of them up at
    night. But the third reviewer was overally quite negative about the thing,
    and so we now have to make some edits based on what they said.
  </p>

  <p>
    A ‘shepherd’ has volunteered to help us with next steps! And we got a
    friendly email from them. It’s the person who was up at night thinking about
    the essay! So it can’t be that bad.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’ve been speaking with
    <a href="https://www.cs.unm.edu/~ackley/">Dave</a> about our next steps (by
    steps).
  </p>

  <h2>Sand sand sand sand sand</h2>

  <p>
    Meanwhile, I’m also working on the next video… Top 99 Ways To Make Sand. And
    I’m doing more writing and figuring out on how it leads into the following
    video — which will be the first video <em>after</em> the
    <a
      href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?app=desktop&amp;list=PL9uRa69RF-7wCDlX55WjK7-gEb9nb3UPm"
      >Sleeping Tode Trilogy</a
    >
    — the start of the next series. I hope you appreciate how many spoilers I’m
    keeping to myself. It’s one of the things that motivates me on — I want to
    get them out.
