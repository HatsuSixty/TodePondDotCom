# TODEPOND PONDCAST: Berd has flown away

Welcome back to another weekly episode of the ...

üê∏ TODEPOND PONDCAST üê∏

What's new this week?

## Arrows in arrows in arrows

The new video is FINALLY OUT!!!!

Go watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNBKdU6XrLY) before reading on. As this pondcast will include some major spoilers!!!!!

I feel such a sense of relief from getting it out. That video has been brewing for SO LONG. And I'm so pleased with the response so far. Thank you - yes you - for supporting its development all this time. It really was my most ambitious project (so far), and I learned a lot of lessons along the way.

As promised, I wrote up all the reasons why it took so long, in this [retrospective]().
