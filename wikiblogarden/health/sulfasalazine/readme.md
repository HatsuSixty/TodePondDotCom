# Sulfasalazine

I'm supposed to take medicine every day.

- two sulfasalazine pills in the morning
- two sulfasalazine pills in the evening
- one progesterone pill in the evening
- one amgevita injection every two weeks
- two estregon patches every half-week
- one triptorelin injection every three months

But it doesn't always work out like that.

## Calm down

Sulfasalazine calms down my immune system to stop it freaking out and attacking my own body.

*I've been taking it for a long long time.*

Normally, it gets prescribed by your local doctor. It's something you can pick up on a repeating prescription. It's a pretty boring drug. You just take the pills. It makes your sweat, tears, and wee a bit more yellow. Don't worry! You're not dehydrated, it's just the sulfur.

## Full dose

The only thing to know is: You can't start on your full dose. That would make you really sick (and I've tried). You need to gradually introduce it. A week on one pill, a week on two pills, a week on three, until you get to your full dose. For me, that's four.

If you have to stop taking it for any reason (eg: you catch an infection, or you run out of pills), you have to restart the whole process. During the gradual process, your immune system will start attacking your body again. It'll be hard to walk or run.

**Stopping is very costly.**

## Refusal

My doctor refuses to prescribe me sulfasalazine. They said that the hospital hasn't asked them to do it. The hospital says they have. I've read the letter. They state that "Luke Wilson will be starting" sulfasalazine. It's implied that my doctor will prescribe it, because that's what always happens.

But not with me.

My doctor is very strict with me and my prescriptions. This is because I've periodically asked them to prescribe things like hormones in the past, and they've always refused. They were also very resistant to doing my blood tests, for the hormones I get privately. I have to travel into central London to get them from another NHS clinic. They also refused to administer my triptorelin injections. My partner does them now, who isn't a health professional. It feels unsafe.

Ever since they refused the injections, they've been really strict with procedures around my medicine. Before that point, there was no issue. They'd prescribe whatever medicine the hospital gently alluded to. What changed?

## Another letter

There's a simple solution, right? My hospital could write another letter, with clearer wording, and then this miscommunication will be resolved.

Every time that I tell the hospital about my doctor's refusal, they're very surprised. "Why would they refuse to prescribe sulfasalazine?" they say.

I ask them to write a new letter, but they say, "Just come pick it up from the hospital. Give us an email when you start to run out."

> Maybe they're understaffed, and don't have time to write a new email? Surely it takes longer to manually deal with it?

> Maybe they don't believe me? Do they think I've just not understood how prescriptions from your doctor work? And they think it's simpler if they prescribe it instead?

## Email

Every time I email, I need to re-explain the entire situation. Otherwise, they refuse to prescribe me sulfasalazine from the hospital.

"Why can't you doctor prescribe it to you?"

You tell me!

## Repeat prescription

If your medicine comes from your local doctor, you can use various pharmacy apps to manage your repeat prescription. I've used it for various medicines before, and it works great.

When you start to run out, you just push a button, and you can collect it from your local pharmacy.

Instead, I have to get a long bus ride to the hospital, and wait for one and a half hours to pick it up.

## Lu or Luke

This year, a new doctor changed my name on the hospital system from "Luke" to "Lu". I didn't ask him to do this. He just did it.

Multiple prescription requests have got lost in the system because they've either put down "Luke" or "Lu", and then nothing appears under my name. 

In the past, I've travelled all the way to the hospital, only to find out that there's nothing to pick up (after queuing for 40 minutes).

The pharmacy has a phone number, but I've never been able to get through to it.

## Hello from the bus

I'm on the bus to the hospital. I didn't receive the usual text-message-confirmation that my medicine is ready, but the reception assured me that it is.

I've been off sulfasalazine for two weeks, and my bones ache like hell.

## Lying tory government

The lying tory government is trying to sell off the NHS bit-by-bit. The people who work at these places are trying their best, but they're *extremely* overworked and understaffed.

The tory government also does everything it can to make life worse for trans people. Tufton street (the cunts that run their campaigns) are behind hate groups like the LGB Alliance. Local doctors are getting scared to treat trans people with *any* medicine, let alone hormones.

For god's sake, do what you need to do vote out the tory government. Don't be too proud to do what you need to do in your constituency. Do it for me, at the very least.
