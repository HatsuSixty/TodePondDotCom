And yes, every single week, I puked the morning after taking the pills. So of course, I contacted the hospital again, and they prescribed me— they got my GP to prescribe me anti sickness pills. But they didn't work and—

Let's talk about what it means for something to be "in your head".

# In your head

What does it mean for something to be "in your head"?

## Everything

In some ways, everything is in your head. All of your lived experience and perception of the world is only real to you because it goes through your head. 

That screen you're looking at, yes, this one. It's in your head. The screen (or screenreader) you're reading (or listening to) this blog post on is— it's real to you, it exists, because you can imagine it in your head.

It also exists in the "real world", maybe in your hand or your desk, or the room somewhere. But you can only know that because it's in your head. By holding it in your head, firmly in your mind's eye, you can start to piece together where it is, what it is, what it's like.

## What is a memory?

Is memory real? It's in your head. It's in your head, and not anywhere else, it doesn't exist anywhere else, it doesn't exist in the outside world. But that doesn't mean it's not real. 

Things don't have to exist in the "real world" to be real. It can exist in your head and nowhere else. 

Of course, other people may share the same memory as you. There could be some overlap with yours and theirs that lets you piece together the truth of reality. Or you could use forensics, archaeology, deduction, whatever it is, to determine the facts.

What really happened? And when? And to whom?

"Elementary, my dear Wilson. We can determine if a memory is real or not by examining the facts, gained through cautious measurement, and simply applying logic."

## What is a memory?

But... "what really happened" is not the same thing as "a memory". They are separate things. One is a history, and one is a story. One exists outside, and one exists within, as a subjective feeling. Is a memory any less real because of that?

A memory is far more than a play-by-play. For example, let's take on a very simple example.

First, history: 

> Lu held their head over the toilet and puked.

Second, memory: 

> FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK I HATE THIS. 

Do you see the difference now?

When I was a tiny kid, I loved milk.

I LOVED IT. 

I used to drink it every day, with every meal, with every snack, as much as I could. (How babyish, yes I know, I was three, give me a break).

Until one day, when I went too far. I finally did it! I drank *too much milk*. And I—

<br>

In the day leading up to taking my cushion pills, I started to feel queazy. I tried to stop thinking about it, to take my mind off it, but I found it really hard. 

It was like my body was learning. It was learning what those pills would do to me, and it was trying to stop me from taking them. 

It felt like a battle. In one corner, my body, the joint-destroying skin-scabbing vomit-inducing menace. And in the other corner, little old me, just trying to exist. 

Of course, the answer isn't to fight. I'd already had enough of that. No, instead I tried to *calm my body down*.

I tried breathing deeply, and developing some comfortable habits and routine around taking the medicine. I would follow my set plan, with no sudden movements or changes! And then nothing, hopefully nothing would... hopefully I wouldn't be sick.

But of course, the routine only helped my body to predict when to be sick even better. And the time between taking the pills and puking got shorter. Now I was throwing up in the evening straight after, instead of the following morning. At least I didn't have to clean up myself before going to work.

Yes, I remember, when I was small, I drank more milk than I ever had before, and then I puked it all up. And it ruined milk for me. 

I couldn't drink milk anymore, I couldn't look at it, couldn't even hold a carton of it. I just started to gag! It made me dizzy, and my—

My body was trying to protect me. It *learned* that milk was POISON.

Of course, in this case, milk is not poison. My body got it wrong, but that didn't make it any easier, and every day at nursery, and then school, the adults brought out milk at snack time, and they told me to drink it. 

"I don't like it," I said. "It makes me sick."

And of course, they said, "Just give it a try. It's all in your head."

What does it mean for something to be "in your head"?

## Feeling

Our feelings all happen inside our head, or our body, at the very least. 

That feeling of sadness, anger, joy, fear, disgust... it's all in your head. 

> I know this because I watched Inside Out. 

And in this case, I was feeling **disgust**. The milk disgusted me. It was a feeling I was feeling. It was in my head. 

## Control

Can you control your emotions? Are you in control of what they are? Are you happy because you decided to be? Do you choose when to be angry or sad? Or is it something that just happens, outside your control? 

It's not an either/or, surely. We can all take steps to *influence* and *manipulate* how we feel. Feel angry? Go on a walk to calm down. Feel sad? Go do something fun to cheer yourself up. 

But sometimes it's best not to. You don't *have* to change your emotion. Sometimes it's best to just *sit with it* and feel that emotion, really. 

> I know this because I watched Inside Out.

## Letting go

It's not always bad to feel sad! Let yourself feel it in its totality, in its fullness. Cry it all out, completely. Let yourself feel sad. Honour whatever it is or whoever it is that's making you feel that way. 

Or if you're angry, then let it sit! Get hyped out! Go settle whatever it is that's got you grappled like this! Don't settle for any less! This is your moment! You can channel this feeling into something good!

Dr Gravy wasn't looking at me over her sunset glasses this. No, she was looking at her computer screen instead (on her desk, but also in her head). Something had caught her eye.

"It says here that you're transitioning."

"Yes."

And then she did turn to face me, before asking:

"And when do you *stop* transitioning?"

Um..

"Uhh.. Never? I think? I don't know really."

She continued looking at me, and then: 

"Right."

And then she turned back again and backspaced through the sentence, deleting it from the first line of my record. I think it was added by a slightly overzealous but well-meaning junior doctor that she was mentoring. He was very charming, but it did cause quite a bit of confusion at the pharmacy when all my details were changed without me asking for it. 

"You don't like needles, do you?"

Huh? 

"You don't like needles, Lu."

"No, I mean, yes, that's right. No."

It turns out, there's another way to take cushion. It doesn't have to be pills. You can also inject it, you can self-inject it into your own leg. And while I do despise needles, I'd do anything if it stopped the—

At this point, I was experiencing nausea all day on the day I needed to take the medicine, in the build up, because my body knew it was coming. And then I'd spend two days dealing with it afterwards, throwing up, and lying in bed, feeling like a zombie, doing nothing and eating nothing because I knew it wouldn't stay down.

No amount of lemony sweets or ginger biscuits could distract my body from the nausea, or all the signals it looked out for to spot the cushion.

Luckily, I had quit my job at this point. And part of the reason for that was that I couldn't stand doing such a high intensity job at the same time as all of this going on.

It wasn't the only reason, but yes, I abandoned all my principles and morals and I entered the world of tech instead, where I could work from home, near to the toilet and the bed.
