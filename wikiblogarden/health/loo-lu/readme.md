# Lu loo tales

My name is Lu. Every now and then, I need the loo.

It doesn't always go as planned. On this page, I'll document every single unusual Lu loo visit from my life.

> - 2nd December 2023: backfilled with every time I can remember. missed out loads but it's a good start.

## Madame no

I was at a curry place with some old school friends. I asked the server where the loo was. He walked me upstairs, and walked past the mens loo. I pushed open the door.

In a panic, he turned around and reached out his hand.

"Madame, no!!!" he called. "That's the mens!"

I nodded at him in silence. 

There was an awkward pause.

He made a squirming noise and then ran away into the kitchen.

## Girls drink

I went to the pub with my dad. I ordered a pint. He ordered a diet coke. The bartender instinctively handed me the diet coke and my dad the beer.

"Oh, the beer is for me actually" I said.

The bartender laughed and handed me the beer, saying, "It's because normally women just order girls drinks like diet coke, and gin. Not beer."

My dad and I stood there slightly stunned.

A look of shock and realisation flashed over the bartender's face. "Oh no no I didn't mean-" he said. I thought that maybe he realised that I'm not a woman. But no. It was something else.

"I don't mean you have a girls drink, sir" he said to my dad. 

My dad called him out and made him squirm.

Later on, I went to the loo. The bartender saw me walk out of the mens. His head exploded and he just stood there, staring at me in shock - as if he'd seen a ghost.

## Lu or Luke

I met up with some old school friends. One of them seemed very uncomfortable around me.

He kept interrupting conversations I was having with other people. 

"But is it Lu or Luke? I don't understand?"

"But are you a man or a woman?"

"You look like a man to me."

When I was queuing for the loo, he joined the queue behind me. He jokingly asked me, "Are you gonna go in the womens?" I said no.

He's a doctor and he told me a 'hilarious' story about one of his patients, who's trans and a drug addict. I didn't get the joke.

I called him out when it didn't stop, and all my other friends rallied around me.

## Depends which one

I was at a meetup with a trans friend of mine. I told her I was going to the loo. She said she'd come too.

I started walking to the mens loo. She walked with me. I didn't know where the womens loo was. I was pretty sure it wasn't next to the mens. But hey, she was walking with me, so maybe she knew where it was. 

As we were walking, she stopped and said "Wait, where is the loo?"

I pointed to the mens loo and said "I don't know."

There was an awkward silence.

I said, "Depends which one."

"Oh!..." she said, before walking away.

Later on the night she told me that I "should really stop" telling people my name is "Lu or Luke".

## It's fine

I was at a coding meetup and I went to the loo. A bouncer tried to get in my way to stop me going in the mens.

I awkwardly smiled and said, "It's fine."

He stood back, a bit puzzled. I walked past.

Later on, he found me at the bar and apologised for the mix-up.

## Legally

I was catching a drink with some old school friends. I was sharing all my frustrations and fears about toilets with them. 

One close friend was trying to explain to me "But legally, they can't stop you." I was trying to explain that it doesn't matter what it 'legally' is - it's still a nightmare.

I think he was trying to reassure me but it really annoyed me.

## Hey

I went looking for a gender-neutral loo at the Southbank Centre in London. I found one that was just a ladies loo with a tiny trans symbol next to it. I felt too uncomfortable to go in because it wasn't clearly marked as gender-neutral, and it had a long corridor you had to walk down to get in. If someone was coming the other way, I'd have to squeeze past them instead.

I went to the gents loo instead. As I was walking in, an old man tapped me repeatedly on the shoulder, shouting "Hey! Hey!"

I walked very fast forwards into one of the cubicles. 

I felt intimidated, embarrassed and vulnerable. When I was in the cubicle, I waited there for a long time, to make sure he was gone before I went out. The person I was with was mildly annoyed by how long I took, and didn't understand why I didn't just go into the ladies.

## Next building

I couldn't find a gender neutral toilet in the building I was in. So I walked outside, and went to the theatre next door. I found a gender neutral toilet there and used that instead.

When I walked out, two women saw me and shook their head at me. I think they thought I used the disabled loo. I don't think they knew what the trans symbol meant on the door.

## What the fuck

I was at a pub in London with some work friends. I went to the mens loo.

When I walked out of the cubicle, there were two men queuing up. One of them looked at me and said "What the fuck".

## J K Rowling

I was at Kings Cross Station and I needed the loo.

I went into the disabled loo. When I walked out, an older man was standing there, shaking his head at me.

Then I walked past the giant queue of people at the J K Rowling shop.

## Two servers

I was at a pub with some old school friends. I bought a drink from the server at the bar. He referred to me as "sir". Later on, I ordered another drink from a different server. He referred to me as "madame".

I went to the loo three times that evening. The first time, I walked past the first server on my way, so I went into the gents. The second time, I walked past the second server, so I went into the womens. The third time, I walked past both of them, so I went into the disabled loo.

After the third time, I came back and told my friends about what happened. They didn't seem to understand.

## Double-take

I was at a tech conference. I went to the mens loo at the same time as a non-binary friend of mine. We walked out the loo together, at the same time a man walked in. He gave me the most cartoonish double-take I've ever seen. 

My friend found it hilarious.

## New office

When we moved into the new office, I noticed that there was a womens loo, a mens loo, and a disabled loo. But the disabled loo was always locked.

Day after day, it stayed locked. So I uncomfortable went into the mens each time.

One day, I got the guts to open it from the outside. Nobody was in there. I started using that one. 

I think it was locked because the flusher was slightly broken. It was a bit fiddly, but it worked fine.

## Strange

I was at an airport and I needed the loo.

## So sorry

After a while, the office disabled loo got completely locked. They put an out-of-order sign on the door too. 

So I started using the mens again.

When I walked out the loo, a young man from a neighbouring office walked in, and immediately stopped. He looked panicked and said "I'm so sorry".

I watched as he stepped out and went into the womens loo instead.

## Oh yeah

I was at a tech conference and I told my friend that I was going to the loo. He said he would come too.

I walked towards the womens loo, and he kept following. 

I pointed out the toilet sign to him. He stopped, and said, "Oh yeah".

## Point me

I was in a pub after work and I needed the loo. I noticed that I looked quite feminine that day, so I wasn't sure which one to go in. Both loos were on opposite sides of the pub, so I couldn't just pick out the emptiest one either.

I wanted to get an honest opinion. I didn't think my colleagues would tell me the cold hard truth. So I went to the bar and pretended I didn't know where the loos were. 

"Could you point me to the loo please?" I asked.

"Sure. That way. Go down the stairs." he said.

He pointed me to the womens. I went to the womens.

## Turned around

I was in an art gallery and I needed the loo. I went to the gents loo. When I walked out, a young man was walking in. He saw me, and looked surprised. He turned around, then turned around again. He looked up at the sign, and watched me as I walked away.
