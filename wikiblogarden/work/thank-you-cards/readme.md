# Thank you cards

I have a drawer full of thank you cards.

## They gave them to me

I have a drawer full of thank you cards. Some are from parents. Some are from kids.

They gave them to me when I left teaching.

## When I see them

They're more heartfelt than I felt I deserved. I cry when I see them!

## What am I doing

What am I doing, here in tech? A world full of money, and not much else.
