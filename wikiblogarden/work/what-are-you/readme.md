# What are you

I was at a meetup last week, and two different people asked me the same question -

"What are you?"

As in - and they clarified -

"Are you a developer? or a researcher? or a designer? What are you?"

And so I told them the truth -

"I don't know."

But of course they insisted -

"No but really, what do think of yourself as?"

And so did I -

"No I really don't know."

And they asked again -

"So what do you want to be? In the future."

And I answered again -
