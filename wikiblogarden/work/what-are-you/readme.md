# What are you

I was at a meetup last week, and two different people asked me the same question -

"What are you?"

As in - and they clarified -

"Are you a developer? or a researcher? or a designer? What are you?"

And so I told them the truth -

"I don't know."

But of course they insisted -

"No but really, what do think of yourself as?"

And so did I -

"No I really don't know."

And they asked again -

"So what do you want to be? In the future."

And I answered again -

"I don't know."

## Repetition

I don't know why I find [repetition](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/repetition/) so [funny](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/art/comedy/), but I do.

I wasn't just saying the same thing again and again. I was also repeating a conversation that I've had many times before about [my name](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/my-name/) and also [me](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/my-name/gender).

If there's one thing I know, it's that people like to put things into [neat little boxes](https://www.todepond.com/report/definitions-that-dont-matter/). And that includes fields of work. 

But in my humble opinion, the best work comes from [blending fields](https://tornleaf.gallery).
