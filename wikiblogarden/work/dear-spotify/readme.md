# Dear spotify product manager

Here are some features I would like.

If you add them all, I promise to triple my payments to spotify!

## Pay artists less

Please pay artists even less than you already do. Even better: Pay them nothing.

They're only using spotify for exposure anyway. So double down on it!

## Add more shuffle modes

When I want to turn shuffle on or off... I now have to cycle through your extra "smart shuffle" mode too.

Why stop there? I would like to cycle through even more modes. Maybe "mood shuffle", "seasonal shuffle" and "ai shuffle".

Even better if they require an internet connection, so that it's impossible to cycle through when I have low connection!

Even better if they pop up a toast, so that I can't tap the controls!

## Make it harder to play music

When I want to find a particular playlist... I don't want to find it immediately.

Please bury it down as far as you can. Guide me on an archaeological journey through your different design systems. 

And when I get there, list my playlists in a different order every time so that I don't develop any muscle memory.

## Remove hearts

Please remove hearts, and all other charmful imagery from the-

Oh wait, you already did this.

## Add more tiktok

I want to scroll down through epic trending content.

Like tinder, but vertical.

## Dear spotify product manager

These might seem like big asks. And I know you have certain constraints to work around.

This is why I make this commitment to you:

> If you add all of these features, I promise to triple my payments to spotify âœ‹
>
> If you have to put them behind an additional paywall, that's fine. Call it "Spotify: Bloat Mode" or something.
> 
> If you release them to everyone, I'll just buy two extra subscriptions (to keep my end of the deal).

Many thanks,<br>
Yours sincerely,
