# Academia

Academia is a place where people tell each other their ideas really really slowly.

They write down their ideas on really really long bits of paper, called 'papers'.

They send their paper bits to someone else, who sells them to someone else for lots and lots of money.

It seems like a really really bad way of sharing ideas.
