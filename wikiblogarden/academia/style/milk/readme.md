# How to milk your demo

When you give a demo, you have to milk it. Here's a simple guide on how to do that.

## Hiding the monster

In horror films, the director doesn't show you the whole monster straight away. You only see a small part of it and the rest of it is hidden, out of sight. But the *idea* of the monster gets placed firmly in your head - the idea of what the monster *could be*. And that monster you construct in your imagination ends up being ten times scarier than what they could have possibly showed on screen. It's why [blair witch project](https://youtu.be/MBZ-POVsrlI?si=gAkMs_6Oh-RjO3ie) is so scary, and [five nights at freddies](https://youtu.be/Z_T0o5uNrlY?si=-TpD5z_syEGkELfE) is not.

## But there's a twist

**Hiding the monster** sets you up for some horrific twists. The director leads you down a wrong path - hints you towards a wrong mental model - tricks you into getting a wrong idea. And then...

Then there can be this magical moment of "it's so much worse than I thought!"

*"This is so much bigger!"*

I *could* give you some examples of this effect... but that would completely spoil those films for you!

It also happens in some games, stories, songs, all sorts, and it's always my favourite style of art.

*It's a wonderful feeling to discover that something is much bigger than you imagined.*

That's what [zoom out style] is.

# Zoom out style

Yes, this post isn't really about milking your demo - it's about ZOOM OUT STYLE instead.

## Zoom out style

I use zoom out style in all of my [talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQgxFuw8f1U), [videos](https://youtu.be/Q4OIcwt8vcE), [posts](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/london/cardboard/cutouts/), [papers](/wikiblogarden/academia/citation/soon) and [demos](https://youtu.be/cF2OF75ivZM).

If I do it wrong, it leaves people feeling bored and confused. But if I do it right, people say that it's ["numinous"](https://x.com/jonathoda/status/1719165351039270978) and it ["changed my life"](https://x.com/cwervo/status/1719437682839875777) and [so on](https://x.com/milanlajtos/status/1716404397356228945).

The approach is inspired by *twists*...

Twists... twists from films, games and all media. It should feel like a *magic trick* where you don't fully understand what's going on - you can't follow what happens or how we got here or - why it gives you such a pleasantly disorienti- disorientating effect.

Anyway, most people don't [believe me](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/men/no/not/like/that/) when I tell them that this is how I do these things. It doesn't matter if they do or don't - I know it works for me so I'll keep doing it until it doesn't.

Yeah so really this wasn't really the real zoom out style guide. The real zoom out style guide is really [here](https://youtu.be/nER7-DVLEjA).
