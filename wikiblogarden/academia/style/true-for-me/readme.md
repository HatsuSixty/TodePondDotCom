# True for me

If I make a claim it has to be true for me.

## True for me

Sometimes I'm not trying to persuade anyone. So I don't care about backing up my points with evidence. But I do want to let people see things from my perspective. So what I write has to be true for me.

Opinions are fine as long as they're mine. Beliefs are fine as long as they're mine. Theories are fine as long as they're-

I think you see it.

## True for me

All I can do is give my view. Take it or leave it, the rest is up to you.

> That's just my opinion anyway.
