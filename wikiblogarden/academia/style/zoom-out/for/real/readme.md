# Zoom out style for real

Ok I put up a [joke post](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/academia/style/zoom-out/) about my approach to storytelling, sorry about that. Now here's the real thing.

## Start zoomed out

When I tell a story, I like to start from a zoomed out overview, so that the reader/listener/viewer can see everything that's going on. 

## Then zoom in

Then I start zooming in on one part, but very slowly. At this point, the read/listen/viewer isn't sure which point in particular we're zooming on. But they can see the rough direction. 

## Get closer 

Continue zooming in, at increasing speed. Most of the original zoomed out view is now hidden from view, but that's ok, because the re/lis/viewer can position where they are in their mental model. They know the larger picture, and they don't feel disorientated at all. 

## Arrive

Arrive at your final point, the conclusion, and stop zooming in.

Your point is small, about some small detail, and doesn't have any impact on its own.

But in the larger, grander, scheme of things, it has some impact - something about it that resonates - some melancholy - or humour - or both.

Except..........

That isn't zoom out style at all, it's another joke post. I made all of this up! That wasn't zoom out style at all.
