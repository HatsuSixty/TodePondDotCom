# Zoom out style for real

Ok I put up a [joke post](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/academia/style/zoom-out/) about my approach to storytelling, sorry about that. Now here's the real thing.

## Start zoomed out

When I tell a story, I like to start from a zoomed out overview, so that the reader/listener/viewer can see everything that's going on. 

## Then zoom in

Then I start zooming in on one part, but very slowly. At this point, the read/listen/viewer isn't sure which point in particular we're zooming in on. But they can see the rough direction. 

## Get closer 

Continue zooming in, at increasing speed. Most of the original zoomed out view is now hidden from view, but that's ok, because the re/lis/viewer can position where they are in the larger picture. They have a clear mental model of it, and they don't feel disorientated at all. 

## Arrive

Arrive at your final destination, fully zoomed into the conclusion, and then stop zooming in!

Your point is small, about some small detail, and doesn't have any standing impact on its own.

But in the larger, grander, scheme of things, it has some power of some sort - something about it that resonates - some melancholy - or humour - or both - some learning that you won't forget because you *felt* it.

Except..........

That wasn't zoom out style at all - this is just another joke post! I made it up!

Or actually, this approach is what I see many people do, and I don't like it at all. I think it leads to rather boring stories.
