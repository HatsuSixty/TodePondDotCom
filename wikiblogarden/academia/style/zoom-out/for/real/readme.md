# Zoom out style

Zoom out style is a style of storytelling where you start zoomed in, then zoom out.

## Start zoomed in

Show the audience a small part of the monster, and let them imagine the whole thing. But make sure they get it wrong! Get them to imagine a different monster.

- Make them think it's a [drawing tool].
- Make them think it's a [2D array].
- Make them think it's a [quadtree].
- Make them think that those loops are all from [different languages].
- Make them think that you'll make [99 sands].

## Show the monster

But not all at once. Show one small part at a time. The order is very important. 

When I demo [screenpond] to people, I sometimes mess it up. It's really important to *not show* the infinite recursion until the very end. If I show it too early, it ruins the effect, because there's no expectation, or imagination, of what the monster really is. If I show all the monster in one go, then nobody cares.

## Why

I think that the feeling of having your assumptions broken is very powerful. That sort of experience really sticks with you. People describe it as [numinous] and [trippy]. It can be [confusing] and [disorienting].

This is important to me because I think that humans are too close-minded on the whole. I think we need to get better at dropping assumptions, and broadening horizons.

Now you finally know what zoom out style is.
