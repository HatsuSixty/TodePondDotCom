# Zoom out style

Start zoomed out. Then zoom in.

## Overview

In this blog post, I'll introduce one of my favourite writing styles for talks, videos, articles, and more.

First, I'll show you how to set the stage - by starting from a zoomed out overview. Then I'll show you how to focus on specific points in detail - by zooming in close on various parts. And finally, I'll show you how to return to the original zoomed out view again - wrapping it all together into a satisfying conclusion.

## Zoom out

Except, none of that was true. Everything I just told you was a lie.

We weren't actually zoomed out at all. We were extremely zoomed in. So much so, that you couldn't see that I was 'in character' for that first section, and that I was lying to you.

But why would I do that? To understand better, we'll now zoom in on the lie itself, and take a closer look, analysing it in detail.

## Zoom out

Except, we won't do that. Instead, we'll zoom out again, and look at everything from a higher level.

What's happened so far? I told you that we'd zoom in, then we zoomed out. I told you again that we'd zoom in, then we zoomed out again.

Can you guess what's coming next?

## Zoom out

We go even further. We zoom out from the zooming out itself, and get an overview of the zooming out that's continuing to happen in front of us. 

Finally, we can see what's going on from the outside. It's becoming meta (ugh). And now it's time to wrap it all up into a neat conclusion. But you know that we won't do that.

## Zoom out

We don't reach the conclusion. We zoom out again-

And it's becoming tiresome now. The law of diminishing returns has been broken, but we'll keep on going. Get ready to-

Again, and-

Yet again, and-

# Zoom out style

Start zoomed in. Then zoom out.

## Start zoomed in

Gather the intrigue of your audience by showing them part of something, but not the whole thing. But let them believe that they can see the whole thing.

Let them believe that they know what it is - by giving them some truth to hold onto.

## Start zooming out

Now show them something that breaks their current mental model - but don't show them *everything* yet. Allow them to construct a new theory about what's going on.

## Zoom out again

Break their mental model again. Get them to think! Get them to repeatedly let go of their assumptions.

## Now take a step back

Zoom out from the zooming out, and let them see what's going on. Invite them outside the curtain.

Let them think they know what's going on. And then-

## Zoom out forever

Keep breaking their mental model until they give up trying to make new ones.

> Yeah so that's zoom out style. I don't think it comes across very well in blog post format, but hopefully this is just a dry explainer about how I think about my [videos](https://youtu.be/Q4OIcwt8vcE) and [talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBYudbaqHAk&t=6704s) and [stuff](https://www.todepond.com/report/definitions-that-dont-matter/).

So it becomes this stupid game of chicken where you keep pushing how far you can go.

Anyway, this post wasn't actually the zoom out style guide. The real zoom out style guide can be found [here](/wikiblogarden/academia/style/zoom-out/for/real).
