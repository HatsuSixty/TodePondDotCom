# Zoom out style

I have tried and failed six times (six times!) to write up my approach to storytelling.

It's called 'zoom out style' and it's how I write my [talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQgxFuw8f1U), [demos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF2OF75ivZM), [posts](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/london/cardboard/cutouts/), [videos](https://youtu.be/Q4OIcwt8vcE), and [everything](https://GitHub.com/TodePond/DreamBerd).

No matter how hard I try, I can't seem to put it into words.
