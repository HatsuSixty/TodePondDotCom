# Zoom out style

To write in this style, start with a zoomed out view of everything, then zoom in.

## Overview

In this blog post, I'll introduce you to one of my more common writing styles for talks, videos, and articles.

First, I'll show you how to set the stage by starting from a zoomed out overview. Then I'll show you how to focus on specific points in detail by zooming in on various areas. And finally, I'll show you how to return to the original zoomed out view, wrapping it all together in a satisfying conclusion.

## Zoom out

Except, none of that was true. Everything I've told you up until now was a lie.

We weren't actually zoomed out at all. We were extremely zoomed in. So much so, that you couldn't see that I was 'in character' for that first section, and that I was lying to you.

But why would I deceive you like that? To understand better, we'll zoom in on the lie itself, and take a closer look, analysing it in detail.

## Zoom out

Except, we won't do that. Instead, we'll zoom out again, and look at everything from a higher level.

Let's think. What just happened? I told you that we'd zoom in, and then we zoomed out. I told you again that we'd zoom in, and then we zoomed out.

So I guess you can predict that we're going to zoom out again now.

## Zoom out

And we'll go even further. We'll zoom out from the zooming out itself, and get an overview of the zooming out that's continuing to happen in front of us. 

Finally, we can see what's going on. It has become meta (ugh, so clich√©). So now it's time to wrap it all up into a neat conclusion.

## Zoom out

Except, we don't reach the conclusion. We'll zoom out again-

And it's becoming tiresome now. The law of diminished returns has been broken, but we'll keep on going. Get ready to-

# Zoom out style

To write in this style, start with a zoomed in view, and then zoom out.

## Start zoomed in

Gather the intrigue of your audience by showing them part of something, but not the whole thing. But let them believe that they can see the whole thing.

Let them believe that they know what it is by giving them some truth to hold onto.

## Start zooming out

Now show them something that breaks their current mental model, but don't show them *everything* yet. Allow them to construct a new theory about what's going on.

## Zoom out again

Break their mental model again. Get them to think! Get them to repeatedly let go of their assumptions.

## Now take a step back

Zoom out from the zooming out, and let them see what's going on. Invite them outside the curtain.

Let them think they know what's going on. And then-

## Zoom out forever

Keep breaking their mental model until they give up trying to make new ones.

## Zoom out style

Yeah, so that's zoom out style. I don't think it comes across very well in a blog post format, but hopefully this is just a dry explainer about how I think my videos and talks and stuff. I really do think in terms of zoom out style for [talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBYudbaqHAk&t=6704s), [videos](https://youtu.be/Q4OIcwt8vcE) and [articles](https://www.todepond.com/report/definitions-that-dont-matter/).

All the best!

Hope you have a lovely day,
