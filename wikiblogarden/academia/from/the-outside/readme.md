# Academia from the outside

What should we do with academia? Here's my view from the *outside*.

## Put it in the bin

Take all of your academia. And put it in the [bin](/wikiblogarden/academia/).

Ok I'm just kidding. But you can understand why though? It's a white-straight-male-dominated world obsessed with intellectualism. The whole 'paper process' saps out all the fun and feeling, devoiding your work of any emotion. "All we need is rational thought and reason" making no room for emotion and empathy. No wonder it's so cold.

Some people reading this will be thinking "What's so bad about that?" which is... uh nevermind

## Academ-ish

So maybe we should try to find a halfway house.

[Ink & Switch](https://inkandswitch.com) speaks with an 'academ-ish' voice. Its papers aren't actually papers. They have too much branding and too much character. I like them a lot!

They're still very long and slow and considered. But I dunno.

Hey reader, what do you think? Do you think this academ-ish approach is good? Yes or no? And why? Let me know RIGHT NOW.

## Why academia

Why would you want to be academic anyway? What's the point? 

Well..........

Jonathan Edwards recently wrote a [blog post](https://alarmingdevelopment.org/?p=1708) (not a a paper) (a blog post) (not a paper) encouraging researchers to publish a paper (not a blog post) (a paper) (not a blog post) to Onward!.

In the blog post (not a paper) (a blog post) (not a paper) he tells researchers that "publishing a paper" (not a blog a post) (a paper) (not a blog post) "is the only proven way to engage with other researchers over the long term."

The thing is, I would have found it more convincing if he'd written it as a paper (not a blog post) (a paper) (not a blog post).

## Good intentions

No but really. I do appreciate the blog post (blog post). Jonathan Edwards puts out a message of encouragement and inclusivity, which is immensely valuable. And I have a soft spot for Jonathan because he said [nice things](https://x.com/jonathoda/status/1719165351039270978?s=20) about me [twice](https://x.com/jonathoda/status/1762195359789392068?s=20).

His blog post (not his paper) successfully encouraged me to submit paper(s) to various things to Onward!.

*Ironically, this disproves his point by demonstrating the influential power that blog posts can have on fellow researchers (not papers) (blog posts) (not papers).*

**Only blog posts (not papers) express the mundane humour, the comedic rigour, the surrealist heart, of humanity.**

Papers don't stand a chance.
