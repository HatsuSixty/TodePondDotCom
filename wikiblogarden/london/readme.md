# Why I love the London coding scene

I love the London coding scene. Here's why.

## Where is it?

It's in London. Mostly north and east. Not to be confused with the London _tech_ scene.

## Who is it?

Including (but not limited to) the following communities:

- [Future of Coding London](https://lu.ma/foclondon)
- [London Creative Coding](https://www.meetup.com/london-creative-coding/)
- [Live Coding London](https://discord.com/invite/RgWgmbGau6)
- [Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/)
- The realtime companies of Finsbury Park ([tldraw](https://tldraw.com) & [partykit](https://www.partykit.io/))
- [Scaling DevTools](https://podcast.scalingdevtools.com/) at the pub
- [Jack Wild](https://www.isjackwild.com/) and his Wholesome dev content friends
- [Peckham Digital](https://www.peckhamdigital.org/)
- [UAL Creative Computing](https://www.arts.ac.uk/creative-computing-institute)
- The [tinkerers](https://london.tinkerer.ai/)
- The [nighters](https://events.next47.com/next47/rsvp/register?e=ai-night-london-hosted-by-next-47-x-incident-io)
- [Taz](https://twitter.com/tazsingh) (he just turns up everywhere, takes amazing photographs, and tells terrible jokes)

And also on the list:

- The tools-for-thought companies of Europe, who regularly travel over ([fermat](https://fermat.app), [kosmik](https://www.kosmik.app/), and more)

And many many many many many more from London and elsewhere. Some travel far, some don't. But either way, London is the place.

## Code is key

These communities are diverse and spread out. Some don't even know about each other! But many individuals have their feet in at least 3 to 4 of them, and therefore... they're all connected.

And those individuals would tell you that there's something that binds all these communities together âž¡ into one scene.

**It's not something that's easy to put into words.**

But roughly speaking: London ships code. Demos, prototypes, experiments, apps, websites, artworks, installations, gigs, products, tools, talking clocks, and _things_.

London codes!

## Cutting through

London has a certain cheekiness and humour that nowhere else seems to understand.

## This is important

tldraw sponsored some of the first Future of Coding meetups after lockdown. 18 months later, I can safely say that some of my closest friends come from those events. This community has given me more opportunity and fulfillment than I could have ever imagined.

So of course... when tldraw succeeds, it's something that the whole scene can claim as its own and celebrate. [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/) decreed it so at last week's meetup (which was again, sponsored by tldraw - as a sort of throwback).

When any individual member succeeds, it's a victory for the entire scene. It's a collective effort. When one person does a sick demo, or lands an opportunity, or makes an impact... we all win.

I'm proud to be part of the London scene - because I owe it so much. Thank you London!

**You should be part of the London scene too.** I don't care where you live! Come visit. Help to make the scene more diverse. You are welcome here!!!!
