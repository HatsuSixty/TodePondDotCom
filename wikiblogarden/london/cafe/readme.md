# Regulars

We've been going to the same local cafe for decades.

## The owner

The owner has become good friends with my parents. They talk about life, work, family, loss. They share photos.

They wish each other well at Eid and Christmas.

## Familiar faces

The same faces appear each day.

When one passed away, the owner travelled all the way to New York for the funeral.

## It's a luxury

It's a luxury to eat at the cafe. It's cheaper to stay at home.

But it's not just a payment to a business. It's an investment in the community.

## The internet doesn't work

The internet doesn't work at the cafe. It's a connection black hole.

You're a million miles away.
