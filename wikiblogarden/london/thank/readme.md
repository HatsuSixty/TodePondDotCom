# Why I thank the London coding scene

I've got into a habit of thanking the [london coding scene](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/london) whenever I finish a [talk](https://twitter.com/threepointone/status/1778515772995948667) or [appearance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVAGf1zVde8) or whatever. Here's why.

## Debt

The london coding scene gave me my community and my career, so I owe it a lot.

In my head, this blog post felt much longer, but on the page it's very small. I guess that's fine. 

Anyway, yeah, that's it.
