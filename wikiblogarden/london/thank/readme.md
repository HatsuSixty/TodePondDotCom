# Why I thank the London coding scene

I've got into a habit of thanking the [london coding scene](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/london) whenever I finish a [talk](https://twitter.com/threepointone/status/1778515772995948667) or [appearance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVAGf1zVde8) or whatever. Here's why.

I'd like to give thanks to the london coding scene, whose hard work made this dreadful blog post happen.
