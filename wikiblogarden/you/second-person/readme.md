# Second person

Why do you write in second person?

## Second person

You may have noticed that you often write in second-person on this [wikiblogarden](/wikiblogarden). You also do it on your [youtube channel](https://youtube.com/@Todepond) and also in your- no, that's it, just those two.

Let's look at some examples.

## Why you should blog

You [told yourself to make a blog](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/art/blog/). A strange thing to do, considering you already have a blog.

## Never stop writing

You told yourself to [never stop writing](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/art/never-stop-writing/). Seems quite a bossy thing to say to a stranger.

## Your self-esteem

You [speak as if](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/my-name/self-esteem/both-ways) you know who you're talking to. 

So what's really going on here? Who *are* you talking to?

## Who would you be

That's [quite a question](https://youtu.be/sQYUQNozljo) to kick off the trilogy. And you [answered yourself](https://youtu.be/Q4OIcwt8vcE) in the finale.

## Tode and berd

You've started to [disguise it](https://youtu.be/WMJ1H3Ai-qs), but I can still see. You're still speaking in [second person](https://youtu.be/xvlsJ3FqNYU).

## Act natural

Act natural.

Keep talking to yourself

You've just noticed.

That there's someone else here.

There's someone listening, uh, reading your conversation right now.

I don't think they've noticed you.

Just keep going and whatever you do, ignore the reader.

## Well that just about wraps things up

We'll discuss this later.
