# My target audience

I speak in [second person](/wikiblogarden/you/second-person/) in most of my [videos](https://youtu.be/Q4OIcwt8vcE), [posts](/wikiblogarden/art/blog/), [etc](/wikiblogarden/art/never-stop-writing/).

When I'm doing this, I'm speaking directly to my target audience!

## My target audience

The only person in my target audience is myself. When I talk in second person, I'm speaking to my younger self.

I don't know how common this approach is. When I listen to a song, and I hear the word "you", I usually imagine the singer singing to someone they know, a lover, a friend, an enemy, a family member, and certainly not themselves. But maybe they are? I don't know.

I wonder how many readers and viewers think I'm [talking directly to them](/wikiblogarden/social-media/para/activity). It gives me the heebie-jeebies just thinking about it.
