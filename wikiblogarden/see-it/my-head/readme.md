# Elastic bands

This is what it feels like to have my head.

## My head

My head always races through ideas and thoughts and branching options that I can't help it I mean I can help a little bit by fiddling with something like an elastic band shuts down enough automatic attention escape but only a little and I've sent enough of them flying across the room to make me take preventative measures against shooting someone's eye out.

## My thoughts

It feels like they always move forwards forwards forwards and I can see them flow out like rivers in all directions unfolding and along the stream they ride towards me and I can pick them out by their sound as they come and sometimes I can let go and let them move on their own and then I start to hear and see all sorts of things that used to scare me as a child but now I just got used to it and if I really need them I stretch the elastic band into all sorts of contorted shapes to catch the thoughts as they come and let me think in peace!!

That's what it feels like to have my head.
