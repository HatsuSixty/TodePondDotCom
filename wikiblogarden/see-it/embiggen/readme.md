# Embiggen

If you're doing a demo to an audience, you must embiggen your screen. 

## Embiggen

If you're doing a demo to an audience, where you're showing your screen - it could be in person, or on a video call - then you must zoom in. 

Zoom in until it feels like you've gone too far. And then zoom in the same amount again. 

## "Is this big enough?"

No! 

Zoom in way way way more.

## You can't be too big

You can't zoom in too much. It's not a real concept. You can only be too small.

## You need to tell them

If someone needs to embiggen, you need to tell them, for everyone's sake. Call out "embiggen".

## Demo tips

When people ask me for tips on how to do good demos, or talks, I think they usually expect something more high-level. Like "plan ahead thoroughly" or "think through the structure" or "keep it relevant".

But no! You need to make it bloody big. It's often the deciding factor. 

## Stevelike tip

I actually learned this from my boss [Steve](https://twitter.com/steveruizok), who's known for calling out "embiggen" during every [future of coding](https://futureofcoding.org/) meetup.
