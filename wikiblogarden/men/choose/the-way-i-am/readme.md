# I didn't choose to be the way I am

Oh. You're transgender?

## You're transgender

That's really great. Good for you, well done you, I think that's a great thing to do sometimes, I think that, like, masculinity is so toxic isn't it? Like, why don't we break down these barriers and let everyone be who they want to, sometimes I feel like I don't like my own, you know, if a person wants to be, like I wish I could be more feminine you know, and step outside my male gender role you know?

So credit to you man, like. For real, man, massive respect, props bro completely. You're killing it.
