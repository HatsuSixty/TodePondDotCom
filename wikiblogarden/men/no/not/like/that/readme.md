# No not like that

A recurring pattern in my online interaction.

## Dear Lu

I enjoyed watching your talk at \_\_\_\_\_ and I was wondering about how you went about building and designing \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ because I'm keen to do a similar thing myself.

> Oh sure, the approach I took was to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and focus on \_\_\_\_\_\_ as much as possible and that seemed to work ok in this case.

Ok well I appreciate your unique perspective however that's not quite what I had in mind. Thank you anyway.

## Dear Lu

I \_\_\_\_\_ your new project \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and it had a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ effect on me that I didn't quite fully understand or expect. How did you \_\_\_\_\_ such a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ thing?

> Oh uhh I guess that I ignored the usual \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ approach that's typically followed in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and instead I prioritised \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ instead.

That's very admirable of you but that can't be right. Also you said "instead" twice. Thank you and good day.

## Dear Lu

It seems like you recently had some \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ with your \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ demo, and I was hoping to get your perspective on how to create \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ like that?

> Ah so that was a lot of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ that took quite a long time to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ so you only saw one \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ really. The mindset I take with it after \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and to try to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. I don't always manage it, but when I do, it does seem to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

No that can't be right, I'm sure it's just \_\_\_\_. Good for you anyway.

## Dear Lu

I've been reading your \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ lately and it was \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and I \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ that I think you should do. Basically you need to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. What do you think?

> Oo err well the thing is I'm actually very \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ about what I \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ so the main thing I think about is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and making sure I \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ because that seems to make it \_\_\_\_\_\_\_. When I done do that, it seems to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. Maybe a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ would be \_\_\_\_\_\_.

No that would be \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. Nevermind.

## Dear Lu

I've been thinking about your \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and how you're \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and I \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ myself so how would you approach \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ in your opinion.

> Oh let me think, maybe I'd \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ so that I can \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and yeah that sounds quite fun actually.

No not like that.
