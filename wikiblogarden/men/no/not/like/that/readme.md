# No not like that

A recurring pattern in my online interaction.

## Dear Lu

I enjoyed watching your talk at \_\_\_\_\_ and I was wondering about how you went about building and designing \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ because I'm keen to do a similar thing myself.

> Oh sure, the approach I took was to ________ and focus on ______ as much as possible and that seemed to work ok in this case.

Ok well I appreciate your unique perspective however that's not quite what I had in mind. Thank you anyway.

## Dear Lu

I _____ your new project _______ and it had a ________ effect on me that I didn't quite fully understand or expect. How did you _____ such a _________ thing?

> Oh uhh I guess that I ignored the usual _______ approach that's typically followed in  ________ and instead I prioritised _________ instead.

That's very admirable of you but that can't be right. Also you said "instead" twice. Thank you and good day.

## Dear Lu

It seems like you recently had some ___________ with your ___________ demo, and I was hoping to get your perspective on how to create ________ like that?

> Ah so that was a lot of __________ and _______ that took quite a long time to _______ so you only saw one ______________ really. The mindset I take with it after ______________ is to ______________ and to try to _________. I don't always manage it, but when I do, it does seem to _________.

No that can't be right, I'm sure it's just ____. Good for you anyway.

## Dear Lu

I've been reading your _________ lately and it was ___________ and I _____________________ that I think you should do. Basically you need to ______________. What do you think?

> Oo err well the thing is I'm actually very _________ about what I _________ so the main thing I think about is ________ and making sure I _________ because that seems to make it _______. When I done do that, it seems to _________. Maybe a _______ would be ______.

No that would be _________. Nevermind.

## Dear Lu

I've been thinking about your ________ and how you're ___________ and I ________ myself so how would you approach ____________ in your opinion.

> Oh let me think, maybe I'd __________ and _________ so that I can __________ and __________ and yeah that sounds quite fun actually.

No not like that.
