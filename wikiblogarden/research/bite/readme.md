# The Bite

I make a bunch of prototypes for my work at [tldraw](https://tldraw.com), [todepond](https://youtube.com/@todepond), and [ink & switch](https://inkandswitch.com).

They involve a **planning stage** and a **building stage**. The bit in between is called **the bite**.

It's that moment when you decide to stop planning and just build the damn thing.

## When to bite

When do you do it? How do you know that you're ready? How do you know it'll be worth it? How do you know it'll reasonable? How do you make that decision?

As I make more and more bites, I'm learning more and more about what makes a bite good or bad.

But what do you think?
