# Fashion show

Most of my [coding projects](https://youtube.com/@TodePond) are fashion shows.

## You're not supposed to wear them

Have you ever been to a fashion show?

The clothes on the catwalk are ridiculous. They're impractical and weird. They're held together with pins. They fall apart as soon as the model walks off stage.

## They move fashion forwards

It doesn't matter how genuinely viable the outfits are. They're not supposed to be sold in the supermarket. They're not supposed to be worn by the masses.

They're only supposed to move fashion forwards. They're supposed to be radical and provocative. They get you to think.

"What *can* a dress be?"

"What *is* possible?"

## You might be inspired

You might become motivated to make something real based on what you see. Can you take an idea and put it into practice? Or can you not?

My bet is that, if the fashion show is good, you leave with broader horizons. And you leave wanting to make something new.

## You might hate it

That's the idea.

## My code is the same

I'm not making something for you to use. I'm [showing you something](https://youtu.be/sQYUQNozljo), I'm [sharing a view](https://youtu.be/DNBKdU6XrLY), I'm [making a point](https://youtu.be/Q4OIcwt8vcE). Sometimes I succeed and sometimes I fail. But at least you know my intention!

My work is in fashion. My projects are fashion shows.
