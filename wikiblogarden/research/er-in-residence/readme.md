# I'm joining Ink & Switch

I'm joining Ink & Switch as a researcher-in-residence.

## What does that mean?

Wait wait I need to give you some background first.

## Background

[Ink & Switch](https://www.inkandswitch.com/) is an experimental research lab that experiments with experimental computing. They're trying to make computing [better](/wikiblogarden/better-computing).

I find their work very inspiring, and I always get new ideas from their (very long) [articles](https://www.inkandswitch.com/) ([Crosscut](https://www.inkandswitch.com/crosscut/) is my favourite).

## More background

This year I got accepted to do a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBYudbaqHAk&t=6704s) at [LIVE](https://2023.splashcon.org/home/live-2023#About) as part of [SPLASH](https://2023.splashcon.org/).

One of the best parts of that experience was receiving feedback from the reviewers. It helped me SO MUCH. It helped me to improve the [project](https://github.com/todepond/cellpond). And it helped me to improve the resultant [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBYudbaqHAk&t=6704s).

Some of those reviewers were from Ink & Switch! Or had worked there in the past.

I also benefitted greatly from talking through the feedback and talk with ANOTHER person from Ink & Switch. Most of the references in my talk come from those discussions.

## Ok the background has finished now

In my role as researcher-in-residence, I continue my own research into *better computing*! But now I'm also part of the internal Ink & Switch network.

Currently, I'm joining weekly sessions, and I've already had a chance to demo [some of my work](https://github.com/todepond/arroost) - and receive valuable feedback. It's been great to see what else is going on there, and to join those discussions too.

## What's next?

I'm currently figuring out the best way of *making the most of the opportunity*. I've started sharing some 'lab notes' internally, which has sparked a little bit of feedback. I'll keep reflecting on my process.

My projects have a VERY LONG 'incubation time', where I think and talk about them for many many months before I start building them (sometimes years). I wonder if this residency will be a good place for that *incubation*!

## What about tldraw?

I'm still working at [tldraw](https://tldraw.com) four days a week - the same as before.

## What about todepond?

I'm still working on my own stuff one day a week - the same as before.

## Nice

Yeah I know right. Thanks for reading.
