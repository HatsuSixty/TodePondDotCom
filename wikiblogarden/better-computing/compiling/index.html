<p>What is compiling?</p>

<h2>What is compiling?</h2>

<p>
  Compiling is when you translate a programming language into a lower level
  programming language. For example, translating markdown into html.
</p>

<p>
  'Low level' and 'high level' are
  <a href="/wikiblogarden/better-computing/compiling/is-contextual"
    >contextual</a
  >
  concepts. What feels high level in one context, can feel low level in another
  context. It depends on the hardware you're targeting, as well as the
  <em>user</em> you're targeting. So it's much easier to just call EVERYTHING
  compiling. Because it's not what I care about, and it

<h2>What is compiling?</h2>

<p>Language goes in. Language comes out.</p>

<p>For example: Markdown goes in. Html comes out.</p>

<pre>
function compile(markdown) {
  // ...
  return html
}
</pre>

<p>
  Compiling has a mysterious reputation. It's a
  <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/">mountain</a>. It's a

    >monster</a
  >. It's for a

    >select few</a
  >.
</p>

<p>
  But at its bare bones, a compiler is just this: Language goes in. Language
  comes out. How you do that is entirely up to you - just like any other bit of
  programming.
