# Just just

My blog post ["just"](/wikiblogarden/better-computing/just) went viral again. Uh oh.

## Just 

Similar to the [first time](/wikiblogarden/better-computing/just/read), there was a large range of responses. But, being human, the ones that stood out to me most were the hateful ones.

People said they wanted to [hurt me](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/academia/citation/intentionally/held/back/). They called me [slurs](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/academia/citation/intentionally/held/back/), and told me to [leave the tech world](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/academia/citation/intentionally/held/back/). I saw at least one call for [less diversity](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/academia/citation/intentionally/held/back/) and at least one call for [eugenics](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/academia/citation/intentionally/held/back/).

When this happened before, I shared some of those messages here on this blog. But I'll hold them back this time, to avoid giving them the attention they desire.

## Just

My gut reaction is to say that "these messages don't affect me". I would like to say that these comments don't get under my skin. But if there's anything I've learned from my [previous career](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/art/in-a-video/), I know that this can't be the case.

I'm human, and I can't help it. If someone shows me some aggression, it affects me. Adrenaline rushes around my body, and I get stressed out (even if they're hiding behind a phone keyboard on the other side of the planet).

It's healthy to feel some sort of reaction here. It means you're not desensitised. And there's no shame in that.

## Just

Of course, there are some people who will read this post, and then use it as an excuse to say even more hateful things. Oh well.

We shouldn't give them any of our attention, there's already no hope for them. What we can do is continue to build a community of our own, that does things better.

I'd like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has engaged with my blog in a positive way. Whether we agree on things or not, I thank you for getting involved and joining in such a joyful way. And I thank everyone who has become part of the todepond community over the past five years. I never thought that the community could get as lovely as it is now. You make all of this worth it. 

If anyone's being a dick to you, it's ok to feel affected by it. I strongly encourage you to [just block them](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/social-media/just-block-them/). (haha)
