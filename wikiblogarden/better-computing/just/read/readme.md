# Just read the article

You didn't read the article did you.

## Just

I recently wrote about how [everything's a trade-off](/wikiblogarden/better-computing/just/). Saying "just use the command line" is as bad as saying "just use the user interface". There's nothing "just" about it. There are trade-offs to each.

And I think we should be empathetic towards people who are navigating their way through these trade-offs. It's not "team terminal" versus "team user interface". It's *just* "team trying to get this done".

That being said, it feels imbalanced. Command line enthusiasts are much more sensitive and emotional, because they're mainly [men](/wikiblogarden/men). This is why I used the command line as the provocative opening to the article.

## Just read the subtext

Many people didn't read the whole article, or they couldn't see the subtext. They thought that the article was "anti command line".

It wasn't "anti command line". It was something else.

Keep scrolling to test your subtext reading skills. What do you think the subtext is here? What do these responses reveal? What picture does it paint of tech's online culture?

## Academia from the outside

Hey this one's going on right now! Couple questions for you:

- What do you think the [article](/wikiblogarden/academia/from/the-outside/) is saying?
- But what do you think it's *really* saying?
- Do you think that commenters have read the whole article? Or just the opening joke? How are they interpreting the article? What are they projecting onto it?
- What's the subtext around the whole situation? What are people revealing with their responses? What picture does it paint of academia?
