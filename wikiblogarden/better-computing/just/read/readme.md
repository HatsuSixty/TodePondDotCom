# Just read the article

You don't bloody read do you.

## Just

I wrote about how [everything's a trade-off](/wikiblogarden/better-computing/just/). Saying "just use the command line" is as bad as saying "just use github desktop". There's nothing "just" about it. There are trade-offs to each.

And I think we should be empathetic towards people who are navigating their way through these trade-offs. It's not "team terminal" versus "team user interface". It's *just* "team trying to get this done".

That being said, it feels imbalanced. Command line enthusiasts are much more sensitive and emotional, because they're mainly [men](/wikiblogarden/men). This is why I used the command line as the provocative opening to the article.

It seems to have worked! It triggered a lot of discussion.

## Just read the subtext

However, many people didn't read the whole post, or they couldn't see the subtext. They thought that the article was 'anti command line'.

It wasn't 'anti command line'. It was 'anti unempathetic tech bro'.

I'm starting a new theory that *all the best blog posts prove thems
elves*.
