# Better better computing

There are **lots and lots and lots** of people out there trying to make us **use computers better**.

I've gone through a few of them [already](/wikiblogarden/better-computing/)!

But I keep finding more.

## Best better computing

Recap: There's [robust-first computing](https://andrewwalpole.com/blog/an-introduction-to-robust-first-computation/), [local-first computing](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/), [permacomputing](https://permacomputing.net/permacomputing/), and [perma-local-robust-first computing](/wikiblogarden/better-computing/).

And not to forget the [tadi web](/wikiblogarden/tadi-web/)! The tadi web is the best better computing of them all!

But none of these solutions are as good as the [cheap web](https://potato.cheap/)! That would be the best better best computing of them all...

... if it wasn't for the [small web](https://small-tech.org/), not to be confused with the [small web](https://smallweb.page/), and definitely not to be confused with the [smol web](https://smolweb.org/), which are all completely different.

Oh and there's the [gemini web](https://geminiprotocol.net/), and the [spartan web](https://beza1e1.tuxen.de/spartan_web.html)! And the [gopher web](https://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/)! And don't forget the [dat web](https://dat.foundation/)!

Each one of these is the best bett bester computing of them all!

Oh and not forgetting the [cozy web](https://maggieappleton.com/cozy-web)!

It's easy, we just add them all together for the **BESTEREST computering web**. And we call that... the `tadi web`.

The tadi web is nothing new. It's simply what you get when you merge together all of the above, and more! It's something you discover. Not something you make.

_The whole point is that it introduces NOTHING NEW. `NO MORE IDEAS!!!`_

Say it with me...

> NO MORE IDEAS<br>
> WE HAVE ENOUGH
