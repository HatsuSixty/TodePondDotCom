# e/acc towards what?

Where are we heading?

## e/acc

e/acc is a gang sign that tech bros put on their twitter bio to feel young again.

It stands for 'effective accelerationism' as a spinoff/rejection of 'effective altruism'. Both terms are intentionally vague ways of calling for the removal of human empathy from 'doing the right thing'.

## Obviously ridiculous

They're obviously ridiculous. Molly White put it best in her article: [Effective obfuscation](https://www.citationneeded.news/effective-obfuscation/)

I'll only add one thing...

## Deceleration 

e/acc bros have a label for people who disagree with them. They call us 'decels'. As in... people with a 'deceleration mindset'.

They think we want 'less acceleration'. But this couldn't be further from the truth.

## Acceleration towards what?

I think we should vastly accelerate the progress we make. We need to make an order of magnitude improvement!

I simply disagree on *what we should accelerate towards*.

- e/acc nerds strive towards a redneck-style free-market, and a world of "technological supermen" (lol).
- I'd rather accelerate towards a different kind of technological utopia. One where people don't need to choose between working or starving. One where people can be free to be themselves without persecution.

## Acceleration away from what?

When you move towards something, you move away from something else.

*What are you willing to sacrifice to get to where you want? What are you happy to leave behind?*

What are the e/acc boys running from?

## What we agree on

I agree with some stuff in the e/acc movement.

- I think we should try to maximise abundance.
- I think we should try to minimise poverty.

It's a question of implementation. *How* are you going to achieve that?

It's a really hard question, full of nuance and humanitarian considerations. But the e/accs are in bed with Dunning and Kruger.

> We all want acceleration, ya silly goose.<br>
> But acceleration towards *what*?

## Belonging

Nowadays, many young men are just looking for a community to be a part of. They lack positive role models, so instead turn to the e/acc movement, or the [incels](https://youtu.be/fD2briZ6fB0?si=5bVjFALYhZHjMpvN).

If that's you, and you're considering joining one of these hateful groups... I welcome you to join our community instead. My email is on [todepond dot com](/).
