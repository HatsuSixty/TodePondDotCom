# and Information

"Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me" is a load of old tosh[^tosh].

## Words do things

Words are powerful because they can change how you think and what you do. That's obvious right? 

If you hear the right thing at the right time in the right way, it can end up changing your life.

## Outside world

When an artificial intelligence model generates words, and transmits them to you—

"The model isn't connected to the outside world. Don't worry, it can't have any effect on anything."

—it might change you.

## Art 

If we think art has no value— no impact, then there's no harm in letting a model generate it. 

"It's [just](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/better-computing/just/) generating images."

But what biases does it propogate? What environment has this model learned in? What were its influences? What informs its output? And was it pinterest[^data] and child abuse[^abuse]? And if it was, is that what we want?

And if these biases are allowed to slip into our daily existence, what will happen?
