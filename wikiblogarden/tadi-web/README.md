## Slippy mindset

The most important part of the tadi web is the slippy mindset.

## Hypertadi

Hypertadi is a programming language for making web documents. It's also valid html.

You don't _have_ to use hypertadi to be a part of the tadi web. But it might be a helpful guide on how to stay slippy.

## Image data

[Image data](./image-data) is an image format for images. It's a subset of json.

## Jumpyscript
