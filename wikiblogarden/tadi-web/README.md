# Tadi web

The tadi web is a small and simple part of the normal web. It follows a tiny subset of the full web spec. This means that all tadi websites work in tadi browsers, as well as normal browsers.

The spec is up to you! I trust you to decide what to use.

## Slippy mindset

The tadi web is built with a slippy mindset. We try to be as ‘slippy’ as possible.

Being slippy means you’re not stuck.

When you’re slippy, it’s easy to change plan, or rebuild something from scratch. It means you’re not locked in to using a certain tool.

If something breaks, you can choose to fix it, or let it die. It’s ok, because it won’t take long to rebuild it from scratch.

    Frogs don’t live forever! They live, they make some taddies, and then they die. The taddies grow to take their place.

Every time you grow back, you’ll be a bit different. You might be stronger. Or you might be better equipped for your changing needs.

## Best computing

The tadi web isn't a new idea. It's simply the result of combining together all of the different [better computings](/wikiblogarden/better-computing) out there.

## Death of the tadi web

The tadi web often dies.
