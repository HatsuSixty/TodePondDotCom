# DEATH OF THE TADI WEB: Worldwide

[Yet again], the tadi web has died.

*Sorry everyone. Pack your bags. Show's over.*

I've decided to end the tadi web project. Here's why.

## Islands

[As I've said before], the tadi web is supposed to be a way of connecting various different communities together.

There are loads of communities out there trying to make [computing better]. But none of them talk to each other.

**None of them**.

And every week, I discover a new one. Why do people insist on doing things in isolation?

## A bridge

The tadi web was supposed to be a bridge between these communities.

But unfortunately, there's only so much a single bridge can do. There are simply too many islands to connect. So you end up making...

A REALLY BIG BRIDGE.

So big... that it becomes... 

## An island

The tadi web became the very thing it swore to defeat. The tadi web became an isolated island.

It was only me building it. And, other people sometimes asked my permission if they could be part of it.

It's not on me to say if something is part of the tadi web or not.

The tadi web is just the natural result of bridging these various islands together. Who knows what it looks like? I sure don't!

## Bridges

But I know one thing. The tadi web cannot be a single bridge. It can't be a single solution.

*There are simply too many islands to connect!*

The movement can't be a single community, or 'place'. We need tadi web enthusiasts embedded in EVERY single OTHER community. Forming... a web.

# Worldwide

## The tadi web is yours

The tadi web isn't mine. It belongs to you!

Nothing is stopping you from trying to bridge people together. Nothing is stopping you from trying to get people to cooperate. Nothing is stopping you from *trying*.

You don't need my permission. I trust you!

## The tadi world is yours

It's bigger than just the web. We live in a world where people refuse to work together. While evil nut-heads scheme and plot, we squabble, we fight - at every level of society.

You're part of this!

# The tadi web

The tadi web is dead. Long live the tadi web!
