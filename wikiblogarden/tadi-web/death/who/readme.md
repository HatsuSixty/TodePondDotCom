# DEATH OF THE TADI WEB: Never heard of her

I'm sorry to announce this... but the [tadi web](https://tadiweb.com)... has died... [again](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/tadi-web/death/clean-start/).

I've decided to shut down the project.

## Why?

Nobody bloody knows what the tadi web is, not even me.

> You're probably sitting there right now, thinking "Who's the tadi web? Never heard of her."

This is because nobody's talking about the tadi web, not even me. And so it has stopped spreading, and so it has died.

The end. Goodbye. Pack your bags. Get out of here.

## Autopsy

The tadi web had various goals.

- Merge together all forms of [better computing](/wikiblogarden/better-computing).
- Make a [web browser](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/tadi-web/entry-points/).
- Invent a new [web specification](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/tadi-web/entry-points/).

All three of these tasks have failed. There is no browser or specification to be seen. And more and more and more ideas for better computing are appearing [everyday](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/better-computing/better-computing). This has to stop!!

## Resurrection

So today, I hereby resurrect the tadi web under a new name. It will now be known as the "tadi web" and I appreciate if you would refer to it as such.

Its goal have also changed to better reflect what the tadi web is.

- It's all about the SLIPPY MINDSET.

The [slippy mindset](https://tadiweb.com) is about not getting stuck, and not getting attached to a particular stack, or approach, or tool, or ecosystem.

## What about the browser?

Building a browser and specification has always been a fun way of getting people interested in the tadi web, but it's not definitively important to it. It's just something that the tadi web makes a lot easier.

I am still working on making a browser and specification. But those are my personal projects, not tadi web projects. The tadi web is READY FOR YOU TO USE RIGHT NOW. You don't need to wait for anything to get started.

## What about better computing?

By staying slippy, the tadi web can slip in and out of all [better computing](/wikiblogarden/better-computing) communities, and bring them together. It allows you to pick and choose the approaches you lean into, *and you can pick them all!*

## Is there any evidence for this?

You ask a lot of questions. But sure, I can tell you that I use the tadi web for all my projects now, and I'm genuinely shocked in how it has changed things for me (for the better).

I'm not trying to persuade you of this. I'm sharing it in order to be helpful. You're welcome to take it or leave it!

## But how

I dunno just search for "tadi web" in the [search](/feed).

> The tadi web is dead.<br>
> Long live the tadi web!
