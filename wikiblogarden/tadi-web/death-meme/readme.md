# The death of the tadi web: How to make a meme

One month ago, the [tadi web](/wikiblogarden/tadi-web) was born. 

Today it died.

Let's talk about memes.

## Bridging

My main goal behind the tadi web was to serve as a bridge between various communities.

I wanted to introduce the different camps of [better computing](/wikiblogarden/better-computing) to each other, that often like to work in isolation - thinking their solution is the "one true way".

I also wanted to serve as an entry point for people from the [worse computing](/wikiblogarden/better-computing/worse-computing) world. Think of the tadi web as a halfway-house to being fully 'better-computing-pilled'.

## Branding

To be an appealing bridge, you need to do some marketing. Figure out what message you can advertise with.

- Are you the "bridge for the good of the people"? Cross this bridge to *save humanity*!
- Or are you the "bridge of extreme fun"? Cross it to have the *time of your life*!

What's the contagious idea that will stick with people? What lands? What doesn't?

## Simple and sticky

The best idea is the one you only have to say once. It's a meme! It spreads on its own.

To achieve this, your idea needs two things:

- simplicity
- stickiness

### Simple

If an idea is simple, then other people can easily spread it on your behalf.

### Sticky

If an idea is sticky, then people can be convinced by it.

> It 'sounds right' and then you can't get it out of your head. Maybe it shows you something you can't unsee. Or maybe it changes your perspective on something.
> 
> You only need to hear it once. And then, bam - it's stuck.

## Death

By sharing my tadi web idea with people, I learned a lot about its strengths and weaknesses.

> I found out which parts were simple-and-sticky, and which parts weren't!

Unfortunately, a lot of it was terrible, so it died.

## Birth

Fortunately, the tadi web is very [slippy](https://tadiweb.com). It's nimble enough that you can rebuild it from the ground up again and again and again and again.

Each time the tadi web gets re-formed, it becomes a better bridge.

Wishing you resilience in every part of your life,<br>
All the best,<br>
