# The death of tadi web: How to make a meme

One month ago, the tadi web was born. Today it dies. Let's talk about memes.

## Bridging

My main goal behind the tadi web was to serve as a bridge between various communities.

I wanted to introduce the different camps of [better computing](/wikiblogarden/better-computing) to each other. They often like to work in isolation, thinking that their solution is the "one true way".

I also wanted to serve as an entry point for people from the [worse computing](/wikiblogarden/better-computing/worse-computing) world. Think of the tadi web as a halfway-house to being fully 'better-computing-pilled'.

## Branding

To be an appealing bridge, you need to do some marketing. Figure out what message you can advertise with.

- Are you the "bridge for the good of the people"? Cross this bridge to *save humanity*!
- Or are you the "bridge of extreme fun"? Cross it to have the *time of your life*!

What's the contagious idea that will stick with people? What lands? What doesn't?

## Simple and sticky

The best idea is the one you only have to say once. It's a meme! It spreads on its own.

To achieve this, your idea needs two things:

- simplicity
- stickiness

### Simple

If an idea is simple, then other people can easily spread it on your behalf.

### Sticky

If an idea is sticky, then people can be convinced by it.

> It 'sounds right' and then you can't get it out of your head. Maybe it shows you something you can't unsee. Or maybe it changes your perspective on something.
> 
> You only need to hear it once. And then, bam - it's stuck.

### Simple without sticky

If an idea is simple but not sticky... It'll be easy to explain, but hard to land. You'll need work hard to persuade people. And you'll end up repeating yourself a lot. You'll end up repeating yourself a lot.

### Sticky without simply

If an idea is sticky but not simple... It'll be easy to persuade people, but they might not fully understand it. And they won't be able to persuade other people on your behalf.

The message will get lost in translation, with lots of different interpretations of your idea.

> What *is* [local-first](/wikiblogarden/better-computing) anyway?

## Death

By sharing my tadi web idea with people, I learned a lot about its strengths and weaknesses.

> I found out which parts were simple-and-sticky, and which parts weren't!

Unfortunately, a lot of it was terrible, so it died.

## Birth

Fortunately, the tadi web is very [slippy](https://tadiweb.com). It's nimble enough that you can rebuild it from the ground up again and again and again and again.

Each time the tadi web gets re-formed, it becomes a better bridge.

Wishing you resilience in every part of your life,<br>
All the best,<br>
