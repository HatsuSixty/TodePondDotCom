# Blending fields

I want to work in blending fields. 

## Single field 

I don't want to work in [just](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/better-computing/just/) one field like engineering or design or art or research or computing or science or community or education or comedy or music or performance or writing or philosophy or whatever. 

That's boring boring boring boring boring and there's nothing good that can come from staying on an island.

## Multi-disciplinary fields

So maybe you work in more than one field like engineering-design or design-engineering or research-computing or computing-research or art-performance or performance-art or comedy-writing-philosophy or whatever-whatever.

but I don't want that either it's so boring boring boring you're still hopping from island to island in-and-out from field-to-field and you're still in one at a time

## blending fields

stuff stops making sense when you stop thinking in terms of islands like thats not how any of this works and i rly feel that if u wanna have a impact u gotta blend down the borders of it all

## blended fields

mb itll all collapse down 1 day into blended fields i dunno
