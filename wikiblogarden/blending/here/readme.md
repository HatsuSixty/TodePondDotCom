> Is your work about “influencing people” or is it about “solving hard problems”?

Here's my answer to that [question](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/blending/goals/community/).

## I don't know

I don't know— it's really hard to say because I'm not really sure what I'm doing and I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing either[^block]. I'm trying to "learn" and I'm trying to "practise"[^prac] I guess. And maybe one day I'll have a clearer picture!

The reason I asked so many people is because it's something I don't know the answer too.

## My current answer

This is my current answer: 

I think I see it as a failing whenever I have to solve a hard problem myself. I have so little time that I can't afford to spend time on it. Also I know myself too well, and I know that I'll end up spending too much time on working away at problems, rather than reaching anyone, or having any impact, or collaborating. 

I only ever build something myself after I've failed to convince someone else to build it. I call this moment "the bite"[^bite]. It's when I can see a potential for something that other people can't. It's not a positive moment— it feels like giving up. Like "ok fine I'll just build it myself..."

I mean, let's look at an example.

# The birth of cellpond

This is how [cellpond](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQgxFuw8f1U) happened.

## The bite

At the time, I was chatting loads with other people working in that space, like people in the [T2 Tile](https://t2tile.com/) community, and also people like [Max Bittker](https://maxbittker.com/) and [Murilo Polese](http://www.murilopolese.com/). I watched as they built tools like [Alchemi Online](https://maxbittker.github.io/alchemy-online/) and [SPLATy Code](http://splatycode.bananabanana.me/) which both experimented with new ways of enabling spatial programming.

Among those projects, there were still some limits with expressivity, and some failed experiments with "conservation". And so I was thinking and talking through some weird "splitting and merging" ideas with people. But there were some issues with it — some missing pieces that stopped it working in practice. 

And then one day I suddenly came up with this "stamping" idea, and I remember explaining it to Murilo and Max and they both thought it sounded weird. Like, they couldn't imagine it. And it was at that moment that I got a sinking feeling in my stomach. At that point, I knew that there was only way of demonstrating this idea.

"I guess I have to make this thing."

FAILURE.

I failed to influence someone else to build it— I failed to communicate it— I had to do it myself.

## The build

So then I spent years and years building it. I built three prototypes. The first one was very dodgy and barely worked. I made all the wrong choices in it, but it was enough to build a short video about it[^cells].

Then I built another version, swearing to myself that I wouldn't make the same mistakes. Then I made the same mistakes. 

Then I built another version, swearing to myself that I wouldn't make the same mistakes. Then I didn't make the same mistakes, and ended up making some unconventional decisions to make it work[^nothing].

And it stuck around and I roughed out its edges[^spell]. And people asked me to talk about it[^foc][^cc][^live].

Wait.

# My answer

I feel like I'm coming at this answer the wrong way.

## The reason I do stuff

The reason I do stuff is...

I guess the reason I make stuff is that it's a way for me to [express myself](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/art/in-a-video/). Five years later and I find myself dragged into the research-y world because they occasionally like some of my stuff. And I find myself getting dragged more and more into the research-y world, having to do things the research-y way, and I notice my work suffering because of it. 

## My answer

> Is your work about “influencing people” or is it about “solving hard problems”?

The first one. I want to promote empathy and make computers better. I already said all this in my [artist statement](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/art/why-bother/).

- I am here to "express myself".
- I am here to "learn and practise".
- I am here to "collaborate and be part of a community".

And I am only interested in reaching imaginative and kind people. I don't care about anyone else.
