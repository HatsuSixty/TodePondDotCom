# The same people

The people banning trans healthcare are the same people opposing gay marriage are the same people criminalising abortion are the same people rejecting women's rights are the same people marginalising immigrants are the same people stopping the boats are the same people bombing Gaza are the same people siding with invaders are the same people colonising are the same people fighting democracy are the same people privatising public services are the same people removing welfare are the same people denying the climate crisis are the same people acting on racism are the same people refusing vaccines are the same people cutting down trees are the same people polluting rivers are the same people.

All the rest of us are in this together.
