# Different worlds

I find myself caught between different worlds, sometimes.

## Content

When I'm making content— videos and— gifs to post online, some people don't understand the way I— my approach to it all at all. For a long time, people have told me that I should 

> make a better thumbnail

and— 

People have told me— continue to tell me that they don't understand why I don't seek more likes— more views— patrons and the sort 

Why don't I have a better tier setup? Or ask for more money? Or promote my stuff? Or— you know— that sort of thing

> Let me do some promotion for you Tode Pond

they say, and

> You should try a few different formats 

Make sure the link isn't in the first tweet

Make it more discoverable

Improve your SEO

Monetize it all

(they're typically american)

and they don't understand at all why I'm doing any of this. 

## Art

When I'm making art— videos and gifs— to post online and stuff. Some people don't understand— actually it's more that they don't approve of my— of what I do. 

For a long time— Still today, people tell me that I should 

> turn it into an art piece

I mean— They tell me that I shouldn't

> devalue my art by making it content

You could create some beautiful installations— projects— explorations with this. Or NFTs (Ha!)

> Why don't you get an art grant? Get some funding and become an artist

Come and do a residency with me— Finally you'll be able to focus on your art and *stop doing all that other stuff*— that evil social media stuff— that you don't want to be doing, really

and it's clear that they don't understand what I do or why I do what I do.

## Product

When I'm working on product stuff— figuring thing— figuring out how a thing can work and be helpful and I don't know— I'm making a thing. 

People often tell me that the stuff I make— what I make is too esoteric— too abstract— hypothetical— research based. 

> I don't see the point of this

What we need is a *product*

> What we need is a *product*

I don't see the point of this

Cellpond would be much better as a game, you see— You could be charging for this— Are you going to make a startup? 

Are you looking for investors?

## Research

When I'm doing research— discovering things and sharing it— sharing videos and gifs and talks and what not

People often say to me

*People often say to me*

They say to me that— I'm focusing too much on seeking likes— more views— patrons and the sort 

> You're doing this in the name of virality— not curiosity or opinion

they say, and

> You should try a few different formats 

Make sure the link isn't in the first tweet

Make it more discoverable

Improve your SEO

Monetize it all

You could create some—

You could create some beautiful installations— viral content projects— groundbreaking research with this.

> Why don't you get an art grant? Get some funding and become a DevReal— founder— an engineer— in residence

Finally you'll be able to focus on your— and *stop doing all that other stuff*— that evil social media— research— pitiful "art" stuff— that you don't want to be doing, really

what you make is too esoteric— too abstract— hypothetical— uncourageous lowest common denominator— just a bit of fun— research based. 

> I don't see the point of this

What we need is a—

> What we need is a—

I don't see the point of this

`No I know you don't`
