# parallel projects

the more time i spend working in this industry the more i realise how important it is for me to work to work on so many projects in parallel 

ppl tend to have one or two projects on the go but ive always reached for having several 

they don't compete - they complement each other

## cellpond + sandspiel studio

[cellpond](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQgxFuw8f1U) & [sandspiel studio](https://youtu.be/qOA-lR3Xc34?si=ObT8djcfa_mkFbnG) happened at the same time

they bounced off each other! they're reflections of one another, joined at the hip with symmetry (in more ways than one)

## arroost + tldraw

[arroost](https://youtu.be/cF2OF75ivZM) happened after i joined [tldraw](https://tldraw.com)

i learned to embrace the 'wobbliness' of tldraw's freehand lines - and you can feel that in arroost

## seet + natural code + carry on + torn leaf

right now, im working on a language called [seet](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/see-it/prior-art/), a paper called [natural code](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/academia/citation/soon/), a visual autocomplete called [carry on](https://x.com/tldraw/status/1782443204710674571), and a gallery called [torn leaf](https://tornleaf.gallery)

theyre all tightly connected! you can't remove one of them cos the rest will fall down - its all part of a bigger picture that im trying to build in my head

its about communication and code, representation versus real, collaboration and [blending](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/blending/). i don't know how to express it with [two beat](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/academia/style/two-beat) words *yet*

## coding + teaching

i started coding when i started teaching. it happened at the same time

some people say "i can't believe you did all that stuff while you were a teacher" and its missing the point

i didn't code *despite* doing teaching. i coded *because* i was teaching. both activities informed each other
