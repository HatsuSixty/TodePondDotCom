# Saying no

"Luke. Where is your essay?"

## Everything

"Well, you see, typically students— it's standard practice to drop one or two subjects, but as you're— with the number you're currently doing, you should probably drop three."

"I'm very sorry Mrs Lane, I didn't get a chance to do my homework last night, but I can get it to you first thing tomorrow."

"As there's simply no way to timetable that many subjects, you *must* drop at least two of them, if not more— and I would *strongly advise you* to drop more."

"I do apologise Mr Owen, it seems as if I misunderstood the task, and I only wrote a paragraph answer, as opposed to a two page essay."

"Right yes, I suppose you could stretch out French over two years on a half timetable but I really think that you—"

"I'm sorry I missed the maths lesson today Mr Samson, but I got caught up on my psychology coursework so I—"

"Well you might have to go to after school classes with Mrs Tracey to catch up on all the—"

"And I was thinking— if I do cross country for games on Wednesday then that means I'll have an extra afternoon each week to—"

## Spelling

"Luke. Where is your essay? It's been two months!"

"Oh I do apologise Mr Owen. I sent it to your email last night."

"So why is it not in my inbox?"

"Let me check. Yes, look. I have it here. Ess dot owen at crossway school dot org dot—"

"And how did you spell it?"

"Spell it?"

"Spell Owen. How did you spell my name?"

"Oh."

"How did you spell it, Luke?"

"Double you. Eye. Enn."

"OH DOUBLE YOU EE ENN."

"Oh I do apologise, Mr Owen. I'll make sure to send it to the correct address when I get home to my computer."

## Blending

"I was just wondering—"

"Yes?"

"I was just wondering if it's too late to switch subject?"

"To switch your degree?"

"Or do a joint one, where I do computer science as well as psychology?"

"Yes— No— It really is too late."

## Everything

"Luke. Where is your essay?"

"Ah— Well, I—"

"Why wasn't it on my desk this morning?"

"Well the thing is— I'm already learning about Sartre in French, so I thought I could skip this one to focus on the rest of the curriculum?"

## Saying no

"Luke. Where is your essay?"

"I'm sorry, I didn't get time to do it because I had to finish my philosophy essay."

"Well— I did say that you'd have to do after school detention if you—"

"Yes, sure. That's fine— I think I can make that."

## Statement

"Luke. Come here."

"It says here that you—"

"We're putting you in touch with—"

"It just seems to me that it's—"

"Who will help you to write your—"

"That seems to be quite a—"

"Because I notice you haven't—"

"A personal thing to write in your—"

"To get this done and—"

"Well, that's because—"

## Saying no

"What I want you to do is—"

"I'm just in it for—"

"Put this cushion on your lap then—"

"On a floating rock in a massive—"

"Put your hands together and hit them down—"

"In a wider universe—"

"Hit them down and say—"

"I'm just in it for—"

"And say no."

"For the bakewell slices."

"No."
