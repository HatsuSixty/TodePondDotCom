Words are so hard. 

## Converting thoughts

Writing is the process of converting thoughts from one format to another. Often, it's taking an unstructured, loose idea, and turning it into something concrete. 

## It's not just writing

The same is true for speaking, and anything that involves words. Actually I should have opened with that and-

# Words are hard

It's hard to make words. It's hard to receive words.

## Converting thoughts

It's hard because it involves converting thoughts between-

They're a lossy format.

When you take an unstructured thought, and put it into words, you're likely to *lose* something along the way.

It takes skill to keep all the essence of a thought in words, and it usually involves tightly packing information into subtext.

Still, words are a great format. They're easy to copy and spread. And there's a joy to their rhythm and pace. I enjoy the pitter patter, step and slide, turn and tumble, of words words words.

## Words don't need to make sense

Words don't need to make sense to do their job. They can convey a feeling without making any sense at all.

## Words are code

Words have power because they can *change* people. They can do a lot.

So words are a really crucial thing to get good at.

The best way to get good at something is to do it again and again and again and again. So here I am, writing *words* again and again, day after day. Some of my words are [nonsense](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/my-wikiblogarden/posts/esoteric/no-more/) and some are [not](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/art/never-stop-writing/on-your-phone/). But either way, it's [practice](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/art/never-stop-writing/).

## Words can be simple

I like to use [simple words](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/academia/style/two-beat), because I like the ring it gives [my voice](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/art/voice/finding/).

When I was a [teacher](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/work/thank-you-cards/), I got quite good at sticking to simple words. So much so, that I started to struggle to give my words any flourish. 

I tried very very very hard to bring it back, but I still suck.

## Words can be frustrating

It frustrates me that I have certain things in my head, certain feelings, that I can't get out. I'll keep practising here on this [blog](/feed) and you're welcome to read along. 

But you don't have to. As my friend [Jani EvÃ¤kallio](https://jevakallio.dev/) told me today,
