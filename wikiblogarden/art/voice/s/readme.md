I write and speak with different voices 

## Todepond voice

The one I know best is todepond voice. It's the most natural to me. 

There are lots of pauses. And broken up phrases. And repeated words. And silences. 

Hopefully it sends you to sleep. Or at least a dreamlike state. 

Some people find it annoying. That's ok with me. 

Anyway, [there it is](https://youtu.be/nER7-DVLEjA?si=mV3XsqqX-8RHaFz0).

## DreamBerd Voice

On this day today, on this very single day, we proudly present to you this presentation. 

Many programmers have been saying that "DevRel voice is evil" and this is what passes for programming humour [nowadays](https://github.com/todepond/dreamberd).
