# Todepond stuff

I'm thankful for all the opportunities I get to make "todepond stuff". All the videos, the projects, the talks, the everything else.

## Todepond stuff

When I'm doing "todepond stuff" I feel at peace and I feel free. I guess I've done it for quite a while now, and I've found a formula that works for me.

I know that I like the stuff I make. It just takes time. And if I put in my heart and soul, I know it resonates.

Some people don't understand why I work the way I do, or why it's not disastrous. They tell me I should do it different.
