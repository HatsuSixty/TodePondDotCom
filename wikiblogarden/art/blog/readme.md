# Why you should blog

Wait wait hang on a second.

"Blogging" is just a silly way of saying "writing".  The real title of this post is:

# Why you should write

Do I really have to go through this again? There are three reasons. I've already listed them out.

1. [Express yourself.](/wikiblogarden/art/never-stop-writing)
2. [Unleash your inner thoughts.](/wikiblogarden/art/in-a-video)
3. [Matt Webb says you should.](/wikiblogarden/my-wikiblogarden)

## But I'm not sure

If you still don't believe me, just [email me](/) with your concerns.

> *ha! tricked you! by emailing me, you would be **writing**! ha ha haaaaaa!*

## But I have nowhere to put it

1. Make a github repo.
2. Turn on github pages for the repo.
3. Write a markdown file in the repo.
4. Share the resultant link with a friend.

If you need help with these steps, feel free to [email me](/).

## But but but

[Email me](/) your writing. I'll put it on my site for you.
