# Burger king

[My friend](https://wiggle.website/@noods) showed me a LIFE HACK.

## Burger king

If you're in a group. And you can't decide on where to eat. You might hear things like:

> "I don't know."<br>
> "I can't think."<br>
> "I don't have any ideas."

Until someone says a really bad idea.

> "I think we should go to burger king."

Nobody wants to go to burger king. So they suddenly say where they'd rather go.

> "Ramen."<br>
> "Pizza."<br>
> "Soup."

It's hard to pluck a good idea out of thin air. But it's easy to think of something better than burger king.

## Burger king

You can use this LIFE HACK in any creative process.

Don't try to craft the perfect design on your first go. Make a bad burger king. Then make it better.

## Play

If you're building a creative tool, how are you helping your user to make a burger king? Are you giving them something to build off? Are you encouraging them to play around?

Or are you just presenting them with a blank canvas?

## Normalise sharing scrappy fiddles

It's clear. We need to normalise sharing scrappy. For the betterment of ideas!
