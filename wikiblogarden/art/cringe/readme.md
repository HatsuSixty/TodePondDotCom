# Cringe

I cringe at my old videos.

## ü§° Faking It

When I made [this video](https://youtu.be/rlO993Jbqpo), I was just starting to develop the 'narrative voice' of the series. I had no idea what I was doing, and I tried to make things sound like a 'big deal' even when they weren't.

## ü¶† Cells in Cells in Cells

What's the point of [this video](https://youtu.be/gv40Z9tVjAI)? I don't know.

## *Stupid little jokes*

When I [first started](https://youtu.be/zLP4ZwudAKs), I found it very embarrassing to record my voice, even if nobody else was listening. So I awkwardly put in *stupid little jokes* like ["Thank you Mr Doob"](https://youtu.be/2Gi8fdvmvqY) and ["Wow"](https://youtu.be/2Gi8fdvmvqY) and ["Hot hot hot slime"](https://youtu.be/2Gi8fdvmvqY).

When it came to editing, I found these *stupid little jokes* even more embarrassing, so I added extra cuts, titles, and effects to them, to try to make them less weird, and to try to make fun of myself. I don't think it helped.

## ‚õ∞Ô∏è SandPond Saga

When I [first put my face on camera](https://youtu.be/nER7-DVLEjA), I found it very embarrassing. Editing the video was tough. It didn't help that I was wearing a stupid outfit in a public place.

## Shows

I sometimes think back to certain shows that I performed in. Mainly the ones that went really badly. Sometimes it was my fault. Sometimes I was tangled up in someone else's mess.

## Teacher talks

Before I entered the tech world, I gave lots of "teacher talks". They're like "tech talks" but for teachers instead of nerds. I choked up with nerves in a few of them and it was very embarrassing.

## Lessons

The most disastrous lessons I taught are tattooed into the back of my skull.

## Cringe

This post makes me cringe. I'll post it anyway!
