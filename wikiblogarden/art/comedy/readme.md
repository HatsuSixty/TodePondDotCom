# What is a joke?

It's about expectation.

You set up an expectation (the setup), and then do something else (the punchline).

But looking back, the punchline *was* expected in some esoteric way (the subtext). By understanding that esoteric reason, you're in on the joke, and you have a shared understanding with the joke-teller. This human connection makes you feel good, so you laugh.

Then you tell the punchline again and again in different ways (the tag) to keep your laughter going.

And when it's all blown over, you can tell the joke again (the callback). This is always the funniest part of a joke. It lets you think back to that good moment, and relive it for a second.

## What is a joke?

It's a way of getting closer to someone, and building human connection. When you 'get' a *joke*, it shows that someone else 'gets' *you*. They know the subtext inside your head, without needing to see it.

That subtext can be some shared suffering that you both go through. It can be an absurd fact of life. Or an observation of society. It can draw attention to something unjust, or reclaim a hateful term. It can be a stupid trick, or some mindless wordplay. Or it can push the boundaries of what is and isn't allowed. It can be a defiance of sense, or a defiance of rules. It can be a banana stuck to a wall, or a pipe drawn on some paper.

## What is a joke?

It's a joke that it's the year 2024 and most tech bros still don't know what a joke is. Most tech humour is terrible because:

- It doesn't defy expectation.
- There's no hidden subtext.

It's just pointing and laughing - also known as punching down.

## What is a joke?

It's a joke that some people don't know that comedy is about human interaction. They think something is objectively funny-or-not because of its content. But that's wrong. Jokes are funny because of the unspoken subtext. This is why they stop being funny when you explain the subtext. The mutual understanding is lost and it becomes cold.

A joke's quality changes depending on who's telling it to who, because the hidden subtext changes. A parody can become reality if the wrong person says it. In this case, the subversion of expectation is lost, and it stops being funny. The subtext is gone and so is the humour.

And if an AI tells a joke, there's no human connection at all. Maybe you feel good for prompting it a certain way, but that's only good for narcissists. There's no shared understanding between two people. It's not the same. Maybe it's fun. But it's not funny.
