# Part two

If I write "part one" to a blog post, I lose all motivation to write "part two".

## Part one

This is very frustrating because it leaves me with lots of unanswered questions and unfinished efforts. Let's look at some abandoned blog post series: 

- [The bite](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/research/bite/)
- [Repetition](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/repetition/)
- [Zero sum self-esteem](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/my-name/self-esteem/both-ways/)
- [Demo gatekeeping era](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/demo/)

In all of these cases, there was originally more content in this post, but I cut it off— I split it up into smaller pieces, to be ordered separately. But for whatever reason, I never got round to finishing and posting the next part(s).

I only feel compelled to write a blog post when I feel like I *have* to write it— I *must* write it.

## Part zero

I'm not too concerned, because I'm happy to play the long long game. I've always thought that "It doesn't matter how slow I am as long as I [never stop](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/art/never-stop-writing/)." [^why]

There are lots of things I'm bad at in life. Like words[^words] and writing[^writing] and getting to part two[^two]. But I do know that I'm good at being patient— I'm more patient than you! And I'm stubborn. I'm very very very very very stubborn. If I said I'll write part two, I *will* write part two. I'll do it when I'm ready.
