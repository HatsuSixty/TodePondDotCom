> Words and sounds<br>
> Pounce out your mouth<br>
> So write them down<br>
> So write them down
>
> Lines bounce about<br>
> Your mind without<br>
> Escape<br>
> So let them out

> And when you write<br>
> You better try<br>
> To make it loud<br>
> With all your might
> 
> When you're low<br>
> Or lost<br>
> When you're fight<br>
> Or flight
>
> Just find the lines<br>
> That hate to be<br>
> Confined<br>
> To just your head.
> 
> Tear them out<br>
> And set them free<br>
> Let the people see<br>
> Inside instead.
