What do you do with your feelings?

## Emotional regulation

When I was a teacher, we helped kids to learn **emotional regulation**. This basically means that they learn how to handle the full cacophony of life's moods - in a way that serves them well.

It involves many steps, from simply recognising emotions, all the way up to using *metacognitive strategies* and self-talk.

I saw children making progress at all parts of this process. I watched them become empowered to handle their own feelings - gaining agency & independence in their lives. 

## It's ok to feel any emotion

You need to know that **it's ok to feel any emotion**. 

- It's ok to feel sad.
- It's ok to feel angry.
- It's ok to feel excited.
- It's ok to feel happy.
- It's ok to feel worried.
- It's ok to feel depressed.
- It's ok to feel manic.
- It's ok to feel nothing.
- It's ok to feel bored.
- It's ok to feel relieved.
- It's ok!

## The important thing

The important thing is: How are you going to express that feeling?

When your feelings are strong, it's hard to hold them in! They need to come out somehow. But when your feelings are strong, they sometimes burst out in unexpected ways.

- It's not ok to punch someone.
- It's not ok to smash the window.
- It's not ok to spit on someone's face.
- It's not ok to call Mr Wilson a stupid cunt.

## Replace it

Don't bother trying to *stop* expressing your feelings. It won't work.

Instead, *replace* the way you do it. Replace it with something better.

- Don't punch a person. Punch a pillow!
- Don't break the window. Tear up some paper, and make confetti!
- Don't cover someone's face with spit. Cover a piece of paper with paint!
- Don't call Mr Wilson a stupid cunt. Go run around the playground with Miss D, and tell her how much Mr Wilson pissed you off, and then come back and explain to Mr Wilson why he ruined your day so that he can never do it again. Listen to Mr Wilson's apology.

## It seems obvious

There's always something to do! If your replacement doesn't help, try something else! Keep trying new things until it works! Never give up!

When you finally figure out a good replacement, it seems obvious. "Why didn't we think of that before?" is something we often said. As well as, "I can't believe it was as simple as:

- eating a banana.
- scribbling on some paper.
- feeding the guinea pigs.

Whatever it is, you gotta find a way to express yourself!

## It takes practice

We get stuck in habits. We get used to expressing ourselves in a certain way.

Even if you know about a good replacement, it's hard to remember to use it. In moments of strong emotion, thinking can go out the window. It's hard to remember to use your replacement.

Some children wrote themselves little reminders and kept them on their desk. Some children asked us to remind them verbally.

Again and again and again, I asked certain children, "Would you like to go on a short walk?" or "How about we go and visit the guinea pigs?" or "Psst. Here's a piece of paper for scribbling and ripping."

> I was a broken record<br>
> I was a broken record<br>
> I was a broken record

## It can be beautiful

These 'replacement' forms of expression can be beautiful.

The ones I saw were creative, or fun, or joyous, or cathartic, or inspirational. They were art!

Sometimes they're a form of communication. They're a way of saying "I'm angry" or "I'm worried" that doesn't involve any harm or hurt.

But sometimes they're merely an outlet for something that just needs to *be expressed*. They don't need to be expressed to anyone in particular. They just need to *be expressed* full stop.

> You could say... They need to be expressed *to the earth itself*.

## It's the same for us

We all tried to be role models for the kids. We needed to show that: Yes, we adults experience emotions too, and sometimes it's hard to deal with them. I often used the example of:

> When the bus is full, and the bus driver doesn't let me on, I get really angry. It makes me want to shout nasty things at the driver. But I'm learning to choose a strategy that helps me calm down. Listening to trance music on my phone always helps me with that. Loud music helps the most.

The kids were great. They'd say things like:

- "Mr Wilson, you should try fiddling with a hairband when you're angry. It helps me a lot."
- "Mr Wilson, you should remember that the bus driver is just trying to keep you safe. It's dangerous if the bus is too full."
- "Mr Wilson, it's ok to feel angry, but it's not ok to say nasty things."

## It's the same for us

We adults experience emotions too, and sometimes it's hard to deal with them. We need ways to express them.

Over time, I learned to notice the ones that work for me. As advised by that child, I find that fiddling with a hairband is a great way for me to 'get out' my anger and worry.

**And I noticed that I could express my feelings in the form of a [video](https://youtu.be/YRBtAn240j8).**

But remember, it takes practice. Even though I knew I could put my feelings into a video, I still often looked for other, more harmful ways of expressing myself.

Again, I became a broken record. "Put it in a video" is what I told myself repeatedly whenever I felt bad. And it worked.
