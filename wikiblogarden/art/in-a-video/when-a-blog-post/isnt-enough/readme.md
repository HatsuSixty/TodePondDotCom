# When a blog post isn't enough

There are certain feelings I can't capture in a blog post.

## Yet

Maybe I'll get better— good enough eventually, so that I can capture anything I want. But that would be disappointing, wouldn't it? Imagine if all reaches of human emotion could be compacted down into a couple of headings and paragraphs. That would be sad, I think. 

Sure, there are some things that I once couldn't, but now can, express in a blog post. I've been trying for years to express in words my [hatred of definitions](https://www.todepond.com/report/definitions-that-dont-matter/) and my— and [other things](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/london/cardboard/cutouts/). I could never quite manage it, until one day, with each case, the words just flowed out. Whether the writing is good or bad or whatever, it doesn't matter to me. What matters is that I had a feeling and I managed to express it in words.

But I feel more feelings that are [trying to get out](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/art/never-stop-writing/), and I've been trying and trying, and I don't know how to do it with words. They [lose too much](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/art/voice/finding/words/), or they're [inaccurate](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/blending/block/), and they convey [something else instead](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/academia/words). So I find myself giving up. 

## Giving up

I catch myself doing a bad thing. I imagine that those feelings are too uncertain, or fuzzy or loose. And that I should try to form them better— to harden them up, or even worse, try to turn them into an *idea*, and you know how I feel about [ideas](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/my-wikiblogarden/no-more-ideas).

I should let my feelings be and [just](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/better-computing/just/) feel them. And turn to a different format.

I mean, it's obvious— Of course, I need to [put it in a video](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/art/in-a-video/). I knew this long ago. But it takes practice, just practice. And practice is what I do[^practice][^footnotes].
