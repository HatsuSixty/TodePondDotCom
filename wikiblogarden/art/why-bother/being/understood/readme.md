## I don't understand

It's part of my brand to make things you don't understand. I want you to watch a video, and not know what's going on— what it means, but you still enjoy it— it feels important or something— it resonates. 

I love the comments like "I have no idea what's going on anymore and it's great". That's exactly what I'm going for.

It's not important for you to understand. It's important for you to *feel* something— a specific thing— a specific feeling. And the emphasis should be on the feeling— should not be on the understanding. This is for a few— There are a few reasons for—

## Unimportance of being right

It's partly a value statement. I don't value being "right" or "correct" or sensible. I value something else.

People who think they know everything already— who think they're really smart— close minded disagreeable people are the people I hate the most. To me, they lack— they lack imagination— creativity, and they lack empathy. They can't fathom that things are not what they think they are. Their views are fixed and they don't believe anyone who says otherwise. 

Everything falls into their orderly view of the world. And if you fall outside that. Well, if you fall outside that. There must be something wrong with you. 

What I want to do is to get people to doubt themselves and the assumptions that they have made. I want to confuse you so that you stop and think, and re-evaluate your fixed views. I'm trying to learn how to do that with my art.
