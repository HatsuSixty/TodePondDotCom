# You can ask

Something I'm learning recently: You can ask.

## Don't know how to do something?

Ask someone. They might not know either. But they might.

## Struggling to choose?

Ask. Get some advice. Sometimes you don't even need the answer. You need to hear the question out loud (or written down).

## Want to know something?

How much money are you offering for this role? What's your gender? What's your honest opinion?

Ask.

## Want something?

Ask for it. Get a raise, get a hug, get a hand.

## You might seem stupid

Who cares.

The more stupid you seem, the better the answers are. People make their answers simpler when they think you're a fool.

> What's good for the fool is also good for the expert, but nobody knows that except me. So be a fool.

## Don't have anyone to ask?

Email me. I'll answer! My deets are on [todepond dot com](/).
