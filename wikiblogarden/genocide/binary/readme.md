# It's ok to be binary

When I tell people that I'm happy with [any pronoun](https://youtu.be/ZMklf0vUl18), they sometimes say "Oh thank god."

They use it as a chance to bash on other trans people, saying things like "That's good. Some people get *so* offended. Glad you're not one of them."

So for the avoidance of doubt... and any confusion at all... let me be clear.

## Some people are binary

Some people are just 'he' and some people are just 'she', and that's ok.

Leave them alone!
