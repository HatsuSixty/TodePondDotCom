I can't tell you what it feels like to be trans because everyone's experience is completely different. 

I *can*, however, tell you what it feels like for *me* to be trans.

# What it feels like for me to be trans

Here's what "being trans" feels like for me.

<br>

# Part one: Girl

*Four years old.*

For as long as I can remember, I thought I was a girl.

When I was tiny, I thought I would grow up into being a girl, and I just hadn't grown up yet. 

I was tiny. I didn't know anything. I didn't know how anything worked. But I felt deep inside me that I was a girl, even in my earliest memories from back when I was four years old.

It wasn't a question. I just "knew" it. It felt instinctive, like a boring matter of fact, and I didn't think much of it at all. I was much more focused on playing with toy [trains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQgxFuw8f1U).

I guess we all instinctively "know" things without needing to think about it. I "know" where my hand is in space. I "know" how warm or cold I am. I "knew" that I was a girl. It didn't come from anything external. It was an internal sense, like taste or touch.

I had no reason to doubt that I was a girl.

Until...

## Shock

At some point in my early childhood, I realised that I wasn't going to grow up into a girl, and this left me completely shell shocked. 

I experienced the immediate discovery that **something was very very wrong**. There had been a mistake! I wasn't going to grow into a girl or woman after all, and everyone was calling me a boy and a young man instead, and it was terrifying. 

I felt like I was being constantly gaslit. Or some cruel trick was going on. 

I genuinely thought that I was going to become a girl. 

It's not that I *wanted* to become a girl. No, I thought that I *really would* become a girl, and I didn't understand why I wasn't, or why I was different to everyone else. 

## Wish

*Five years old.*

I deduced that I was probably the only person like this in the entire world, and that no one would believe me if I told them. I thought they would laugh at me, or think I was crazy.

Every single time I got to "make a wish" by blowing out birthday candles, I always wished that I would "wake up as a girl the next day without anyone noticing". It would be "as if I had always been a girl".

I sometimes cried about it on my own. I didn't know why this was happening to me, and I didn't understand. I just wanted help, but I didn't feel brave enough to talk to anyone, despite all my family and friends being lovely to me. I felt too ashamed. I felt like a freak.

It was a waking nightmare. I was living in a horror film where I was both the victim and the monster.

## Boy

*Six years old.*

I became more familiar with my lived experience. I grew to understand my "condition".

I felt it as this deeply uncomfortable mixture of conflicting signals, all coming from my own body. On the one hand, my instinct and senses were telling me that I was a girl. On the other hand, my eyes and ears were telling me something completely different— that I was a boy.

> It's a very nauseating feeling. It's very hard to describe, but it's a feeling of tension. It makes me feel "unresolved" at all times, like I have an itch that I can't scratch, or I need to sneeze but I can't. It's as if my head is detecting that two of its senses don't match up and it can't stop trying to work it out. It works overtime on trying to figure out which one is right and which one is wrong. I can't relax, or focus on anything else at times. All I can think of is my head constantly telling me "EVERYTHING IS WRONG" and "YOU ARE WRONG" without pause. I can't do *anything* without thinking it.

Sometimes I just wanted the feeling to "shut up" for a while to let me get on with my life and *play with toy trains* and stuff. 

As a six year old, I thought to myself that my teddy bear (aptly named "Teddy") was the only 'person' in the world that truly knew me and how I felt. He was the only one that understood me. And at night I would whisper to my teddy bear, "You're the only one who really knows me, Teddy".

> As I think back to this I feel intense cringe as well as intense pity for my younger self. I can't help but go a bit watery-eyed remembering and reliving my helpless struggle towards making sense of everything going on within and around me with such little success for so many years. I don't think I've ever really got over the trauma of those days. 

## Man

Of course, I held no hope that I would ever resolve my issues. I thought I would carry them to my grave.

## Relief

*Seven years old.*

I realised that I could very temporarily make my discomfort go quiet by "pretending" to be a girl. With my siblings and cousins and friends, we sometimes played games where we pretend to be characters, and dress up as them. We were spies and we were soldiers and we were superheroes and all sorts. I loved "performing" because it meant you could *be somebody else*.

I could act as a woman or a girl, or I could dress up in a dress or a skirt. And for those brief moments— those brief moments felt like relief, intense relief. 

It would shut down one of the signals that my body was experiencing, or it would boost the other one. Either way, I could get myself to 'feel' that I really was a girl, even for a split second, and the discomfort would subside momentarily. My body would stop feeling confused. 

And in those moments, I caught glimpses of possibilities of a better life— of how life could be better. If only I could stop thinking about this discomfort all the time, imagine all the things I could do. I could feel more confident and comfortable in my own skin, I could stop feeling so shy and ashamed and like some kind of monster. I could study and make stuff and express myself and have fun and I could *play with so many toy trains*.

Here's the odd part. I was never drawn towards girly things. I never actually liked dresses or skirts or pink things or that kind of thing. But I liked them in this "use case" because they were extremely strong signals to my brain. They were strong signals, strong enough to shut down all the others. I didn't like dresses, but if I was wearing one, then I had no option but to think I was a girl, and I could be at peace. 

However, I found it increasingly tricky to find or create these opportunities. As I grew older, "dressing up" and "playing pretend" became less and less cute and more and more weird. I struggled. Friends and siblings and cousins didn't want to do it anymore, and I felt deeply embarrassed to ask to do it. Those fleeting moments of relief were gone, and I was back to living in discomfort and pain 24/7.

## Pain

Let me completely clear, the discomfort I felt was extremely intense. It was painful. It felt psychological torture. The worst part was waking up each day. 

You see, in my dreams, I was always a girl. It wasn't an odd thing, or a surprise. Like it wasn't "Oh weird, I'm a girl!"

It was "I'm a girl, like always".

So every single morning, I experienced the whiplash of emotions that was the rediscovery of the fact that I was in fact a boy. Wake up, get shocked that I'm a boy, remember that I always was a boy, feel confused, feel angry, feel sad, feel uncomfortable, feel ashamed.

I didn't know why I felt like a girl, I never knew or understood it. I just knew that I felt it and I couldn't shut it off, as much as I tried. I wished that I could either stop feeling it, or someone magically become a girl, so that I could just live my life and PLAY WITH TOY TRAINS.

## Character

*Eight years old.*

I carried on enjoying performing and joking around and being silly characters. I joined drama clubs and did shows and improv and stuff, and it was really fun. At these clubs, I felt like I could just become a character, and *be me*. It doesn't seem to make sense, but by being someone else I could feel more myself. I guess it was because I was *supposed* to feel like someone else during those times, and it was *supposed* to feel unusual. 

And it was escapism. I could escape my prison momentarily. I could escape myself and be someone else! 

Funnily enough, it felt like escape to be a "man character" as much as it was to be a "woman character". Anything to escape the painful clash of feelings that experienced each day. 

*"If only I could be either a boy or a girl. Then everything would be so much easier."*

Still, I thought and knew that I was a girl, and I knew I couldn't shut those feelings down. Heaven knows I tried.

## Escape

I played Pokemon Crystal and Professor Oak asked me a question. 

> "Are you a boy? Or are you a girl?"

I'm a girl of course!

I felt such joy and relief from playing this game. I spent hours and hours and hours and hours playing it. It was my escape from the uncomfortable world around me. I could be a girl! Finally! I didn't have to worry about anything else.

And this was perhaps the beginnings of my exceptional talent for procrastination and problem avoidance.

## Fantasy

*Nine years old.*

Escapism was my outlet. I continued experiencing the same daily discomfort, the pain of waking up, the confusion, and the shame of it all. And I could give myself a break by fantasising and imagining intricate stories. 

What if scientists somehow discover me, and realise that I have some genetic problem with me that stops me looking like a girl like I'm supposed to. And it's some crazy worldwide shock and discovery, and the TV and press get involved, and they fix my— uhh— they do like gene therapy or something— or put me in a big machine or something. "For science!"

Those science boffins must get to the root of this— um— "For the sake of humanity— knowledge!"

And they **must** turn me *back* into a girl. (Ha ha "wouldn't that be awful" I could say to everyone else).

Yes yes yes— the science boffins— the government perhaps— The Queen Herself decrees that I must be transformed into a girl using the Girl-O-Matic (no wait that sounds Wallace & Gromit)— I must enter the Girltron 8000 as instructed by The Queen. And I walk out as a girl. And it *wasn't my choice* you see. Then I can have— it gives me plausible deniability! I don't need to experience any shame over it. I could become a girl without any embarrassment, if only The Queen would command me by law into the Girltron.

Simple!!!

Simple. That's how I become a girl.

## Paranoia

I grew increasingly afraid that someone would figure out my **big secret**.

And they would find out these embarrassing stories that I would tell myself as I fell asleep, hugging Teddy.

I was scared to even pick a girl character in video games. I lost that outlet as I became increasingly secretive.

I picked a male character in RuneScape. And then I paid 3000 gold to the Makeover Mage to turn my character into a woman. Phew! That's better. 

And then I felt embarrassed. What would everyone think if they saw my character!!!!!!!! So I paid 3000 gold to turn back.

Then I regretted it, and paid 3000 gold to turn back into a woman. "It's just a joke though. So random. Ha ha."

Then I felt embarrassed and paid 3000 to switch back again. 

Then I switched back. 

Then I switched back again. 

> Little did I know how much this would foreshadow my future gender expression.

# Part two: ⚠️ PUBERTY ⚠️

DISASTER!

*Ten years old.*

This is when it all started to go REALLY wrong.

Unfortunately, I started to feel attracted to women.

I also started to feel attracted to men but I would only become aware of that fifteen years later.

And of course,
