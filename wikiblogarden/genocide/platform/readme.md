# Platform

I find myself with a platform. 

## You're reading this

Most days, I sit down and write a blog post— Or rather— I'm sitting down with nothing to do, so I decide to write a blog post. 

For me, it's practice.

## It's practice

I write to practise writing. I always struggle with writing so my solution is to write loads.

Writing helps me to get better at articulating myself. In a way, "speaking" feels like a form of writing - it [just](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/better-computing/just/) happens in real time. 

With writing, I get to look back and edit, to restructure and improve, my words. I can look at the kind of—

With writing, I get to look back and edit my words. I get to restructure and improve my sentences. I can scrub through different styles, both the formal and the—

## I write to practise writing

I always struggle with writing so my solution is to write loads. 

As I write, I get to look back and edit my words, restructure and improve my sentences. I flit— I explore the different styles available to me—

I'm not working on a particular style of writing. It's more that I'm— I explore the styles of writing that are available to me. I develop my [voice](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/art/voice/finding/).

As I do this, I learn to articulate myself better, a skill I have always struggled with— Writing helps me— I find [words](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/academia/words) so—

Whether I'm writing a script, or giving a talk, or leading a meeting— answering a question, there's writing— always writing involved, whether it's written down or not— on paper or with speech— with letters or voice— So I practise it— practise every day—

## It's like a diary

What should I write about, when I practise writing? 

I suppose— I write whatever's on my mind, so it turns into a sort of diary. Sometimes it's [personal](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/genocide/visibility/) and sometimes it's— Actually— It's always personal[^true-for-you].

Some of my posts get a lot of [attention](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/london/cardboard/cutouts/) and some [don't](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/health/transition/in-slow-motion/). But that's not the point. Or is it? Is that the point? 

Why do I write? Is it to help me? Or you? To figure something out? Or get across a point? Can practice be more than [just](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/better-computing/just/) practice? Or—

## You're reading this

So— I find myself wondering what to say. The fact that someone out there is listening— is reading— is listening— 

I could tell you about the genocide in Gaza. I could tell you about the different kind of genocide happening here. I could give you some advice, or cheer you up— wake you up, or calm you down—

I could write about something important. About the struggle I experience to get my medicine and exist. Or I could write about— I can't possibly find— It's hard to find— Too many times— It's beyond— It feels so—

## The struggle for topic

I am here, and so are you. And I guess we could wonder— wonder what to do.

What code should I transmit today? And who is it for? Who is to say?

Is it really [just](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/better-computing/just/) practice? And nothing more? 

I find myself with a platform— Can practice be just— Can practice be more?— Can practice be ... either or?— on the floor?— out the door?— a bore— snore?— outlawed?— a monkey's paw?—

Is it really [just](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/better-computing/just/) practice? And nothing more?

## Around a topic

I typically write loads of things down around a single topic. Then I [cut and cut and cut](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/repetition/quality/control/) until there's almost nothing left. Then I publish it. I probably need to write about ten times more than the length of the actual thing— This post is what it looks like if I don't cut at all— only add. And it becomes a game of itself.

And it doesn't feel right, to play such a "game" over topics so real and important.

But here I am. I find myself with a platform. I must make the most of it. And for that I need practice.

# Just practice

Most days, I write a blog post. Most days, people read it.

For one reason or other, I find myself with a platform.

If I didn't make the most of that, I'd be a fool.

And for that I need practice! [Just](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/better-computing/just/) practice.
