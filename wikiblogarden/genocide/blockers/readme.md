# Puberty blockers

They've [stopped](https://www.thepinknews.com/2024/03/12/trans-puberty-blockers-nhs-england-prescribe-gender-affirming-healthcare/) giving puberty blockers to trans kids and I can't believe it. The pain and torment that this will cause is unbearable to think of.

## It was bad anyway

It was [exceedingly hard](https://www.thepinknews.com/2023/02/09/tavistock-gender-clinic-closure-staff-open-letter-trans-healthcare/) to get access to blockers anyway. So this is just the final nail in the coffin for countless trans children, unfortunately quite literally.

## Blockers changed my life

I take hormone blockers and they've made my life immeasurably better. I'm glad I'm on them now but god I wish I could have started them sooner.

All that torture I went through could have been avoided.

## Not everyone

Not every trans child wants to take hormone blockers, but many many many many many do. So why deny them the right to their own body? Why force them through misery? It's obvious right?

## The cruelty is the point

It's a hateful act, designed to persecute a people. We're way beyond the G word.

## They're coming for me next

Trans children are just the start. We all know who's next. Are you just gonna stand there and watch?

When it comes to hormones, or arse-holes, my policy is the same:
