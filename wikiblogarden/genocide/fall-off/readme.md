# Fall off

brushing leaves\
bouncing branches\
sunrays passing through 

ice cream dripping\
music muffled\
people nodding as they look

(and)

i'm checking twitter\
i didn't want to\
but it's a habit that i do

(and you)

you ask me if i'm listening\
and i\
can't quite say i am 

(and on the site it said) 

they're banning blockers\
though not for me\
but if they did\
i wouldn't know what to do

(and so i sip)

my warming beer\
and grab the grass\
as if i could\
hold on the earth

(enough that i won't fall off)
