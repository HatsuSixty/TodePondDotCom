# Clickbait title

I tried and tried to write a number of blog posts today but I couldn't get anything out. The [cass report](https://www.thepinknews.com/2024/04/11/cass-report-anti-trans-bigots/) kept sticking out in my head, and I felt like I had to write something about that instead. 

Honestly it gets tiring trying to make everyone aware of every single little bit of persecution that trans people go through in my country. Go do your own reading.
