# Peace

Today is christmas day.

I'm not religious at all, but I've always done christmas.

## Peace

Seems as good a time as any to wish for peace.

May all the genocides of our world come to an end!

Today I am thinking of all the people in Gaza, Ukraine, and everywhere else. The persecuted queer people of my country, and others. The climate refugees. The homeless. And those we have already lost.

And fuck the nob-heads that make things worse!!!!!!!!
