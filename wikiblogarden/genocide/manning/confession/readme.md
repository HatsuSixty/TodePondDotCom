# Manspreading and mansplaining

It's worse than I thought.

## My confession

I had no idea it was this bad. And now... I feel like a complete arsehole and idiot.

All the women in my life told me this. And I listened, yeah, I listened. And I thought I knew. I thought I understood.

But I didn't think it was *that* bad.

"Surely it can't be *that* bad."

## It is bad

It is really bad.

Gotta figure out how to express this feeling best... I've written out a few things but nothing does it justice. I feel this frustration, because men just **don't know**. If you're a man, and you're reading this... I promise you that you **don't know**.
