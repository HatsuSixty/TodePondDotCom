# Time is not a circle

[Some people](/wikiblogarden/academia/citation/intentionally/held/back) have been saying that time is a circle.

They think that everything that happens has happened before, and will happen again, at least in some form. They think that our world has a habit of repeating itself. They think that we're "cursed with eternal repetition".

But...

## Can you see it?

Once upon a time, our universe started. Then nine billion years happened. Then our planet formed. Then four and a half billion years passed.

Can you see it? Can you visualise the timeline?

## The line

On the far left it's the start of the universe. On the far right it's the present day.

- The full timeline represents the age of the universe.
- One third of the timeline represents the age of planet earth.
- One hundredth of the timeline represents the time between the rise and fall of the dinosaurs.
- And the entirety of human existence can fit into a section that's zero point zero zero two percent of the whole timeline. 

> As a species, the dinosaurs lasted over 500 times more than we have so far.

Your entire life, assuming you live to 100 years old, fills up 0.0000007% of the line.

## Time is a line

We're not cursed with eternal repetition because we're cursed with a start and end.
