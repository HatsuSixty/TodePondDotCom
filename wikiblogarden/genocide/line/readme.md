# Time is not a circle

*Some people* out there have been saying that time is a circle, a flat circle.

They think that everything that happens has happened before, and will happen again, at least in some form. They think that our world has a habit of repeating itself. They think that we're cursed with eternal repetition.

But they're wrong.

## Time is a line

Once upon a time, our universe started. Then nine billion years happened.

Then our planet formed. Then four and a half billion years passed.

Can you see it? Can you visualise the timeline?

## The line

On the far left it's the start of the universe. On the far right it's the present day.

The entire timeline represents the age of the universe.

One third of the timeline represents the age of planet earth.

One hundredth of the timeline represents the time between the rise and fall of the dinosaurs.

What about humans? The entirety of human existence can be fit onto a section that's zero point zero zero two percent of the whole timeline. 

As a species, the dinosaurs lasted over 500 times more than we have so far.

Your entire life, assuming you live to 100 years old, represents 0.0000007% of the line.

## Time

We're not cursed with eternal repetition because we're cursed with a start and end.
