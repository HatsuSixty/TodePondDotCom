# My twitter rules 

For the past 17 months, I've been following some strict rules for how I use twitter.

But first...

## Twitter is a vile website

Twitter is a [vile website](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/social-media/hackernews/), as we [already know](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/genocide/twitter/died/).

On twitter, hateful voices are platformed[^hate], while queer voices are suppressed[^queer]. So ideally, I wouldn't use twitter at all. And I feel very guilty about how much I do use it.

One day, I won't use twitter at all. Hopefully sooner rather than later. But for now, here are the current rules I follow. I've been following them for 17 months.

## My twitter rules

- No posting up any media of [todepond work](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/art/todepond/stuff/). This means no gifs, screenshots, videos or anything. This also means that I don't use the todepond logo for my avatar. This was a very big change for me.
- Links are allowed because they take people away from twitter.
- Posting media of my tldraw work is allowed because I see it as part of my job and I want to do right by my team.
- Satire and punching up is allowed because it's a resistance against the hateful arseholes running twitter.
- Photos of myself are allowed because it's a resistance against twitter wanting to make queer people less visible.
- No consuming twitter content outside of work hours. I don't browse twitter unless I'm sat at my work desk on my computer. And I only do this via my computer - not my phone. I use twitter for my work. The rest of the time, it's a write-only platform. My only day-to-day consumption of it comes from the notifications I receive. Speaking of notifications...
- No push notifications. If I want to see my notifications, I have to open it up. 
- No native apps. I refuse to have twitter on my phone, or any device. I only access it through my web browser. 
- No ads. I always use an ad-blocker when I'm on twitter. This means I have to use firefox on my phone.
- Ephemeral posts. I delete most of my tweets a day or two after I post them.
- I *must* take a break from these rules on the 24th January 2034, and not before then. This is part of my mental-gymnastics habit-forming method (that I really should write about some time).

## Breaking the rules

I've been pretty good at following the rules. 

Occasionally, I do some mental gymnastics to let myself post todepond media up there. I tell myself "but this gif is fine because it's technically blah blah blah" or something. Whenever this happens, I end up removing the gif and owning up to my sin, and referring people to [my mastodon](https://elk.zone/mas.to/@TodePond) instead (where I do post all my stuff).

A lot of the time, I can get other people to post my stuff for me. Like... I'll post a link to my work, and then someone else will post a screenshot or gif of it. This keeps my conscience relatively satisfied, but it probably wouldn't happen if I didn't post the link in the first place. Maybe I could try to discourage people from doing this. Or maybe it helps to draw people away from twitter to my stuff elsewhere. I'm not sure.

Recently, I think I've been getting dangerously close to doing non-satire text posting. Or rather, it hasn't been satirical *enough*. I'm tempted to ban myself from doing text posts altogether, because I might not be able to trust myself to keep it as worthwhile up-punching.

## I should write some sort of conclusion

Here are some learnings I've picked up from this: 

- Platforms like twitter are very addictive. My rules are strict and complicated to try to match that. It kind of gamifies against the gamification of twitter. 
- I have an outlet for this addiction via my work. I can post work stuff still, via my own account and the work account, and this feels like a betrayal of the whole system. But twitter is pivotal in marketing for web development. Maybe I should change careers again!?!?
- Mastodon is really nice because it feels so hidden. Please don't bother us. 
- Twitter's community has become more and more monoculture. More and more boring loud [men](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/men). And all my favourite people have left. Many have moved to mastodon or bluesky. Many have quit microblogging altogether. 
- At meetups, everyone used to share twitter handles. Now, more and more people are sharing linkedin handles. Linkedin is depressing, but at least it's not twitter.
- Hardly anyone cares. Nobody seems to care.
