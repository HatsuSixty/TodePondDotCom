# Telling the same story in many ways

I submitted an application to [LIVESPLASH](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/academia/style/never/use/acronyms/). 

## Telling the same story

The application is in the form of an essay about [Arroost](https://github.com/todepond/arroost). And it means that I've now told the same story— the story of Arroost in quite a few different ways. 

- [An artistic presentation](https://youtu.be/cF2OF75ivZM)
- [An artistic video](https://youtu.be/DNBKdU6XrLY)
- [A personal essay](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/scrappy-fiddles/sharing/normalising/live/)
- A semi-serious essay (I will share it at some point)

And if I get accepted, I will have to do it in yet another way.

- A semi-serious talk (if I get accepted)

But who knows if that will happen. I know that loads and loads and loads of amazing people applied to LIVESPLASH this year, so I won't be massively sad if I get rejected. In fact, that might be the most [normalise sharing scrappy fiddles](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/scrappy-fiddles/sharing/normalising/live/) outcome of all.

## In many ways

I think it's good to tell the same story in many ways because it becomes so much richer by being expressed in different ways. It lets you see/approach it from different angles, and it lets you reach a far wider— far more blended audience.

The only thing that matters is [blending](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/blending/).
