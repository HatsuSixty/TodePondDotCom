why does a blog post need a title anyway? it doesn't *need* one. it doesn't need one

sure sure sure sure sure sure it might help but it doesn't *need* it. it's fine without it. it's fine. look, this works fine

communication must surely be the most important thing to get good at, I really think so

and that includes writing!

writing isn't just for essays or blog posts or things. writing can be for so many things. you need to write a talk. you need to write a pitch. you need to write a slogan

titles are a crutch. they signpost signal what's written below. but if you need that, then you're not writing punchy enough.

in school they try to teach you to write, but it's nonsense.

they only teach you *one specific way* of writing that that that makes you sound smart and you, it sounds professional but is it good? is it impactful does it make an impact? 

it's only one way to write.

this is my real training, learning. i am trying to push myself to write better without my crutches. i learned to rely on titles so i must remove them. and the result at first might be worse, or unreadable even

but you you will watch me get better! and figure it out, day by day I'll write a little bit better than before.

there are so many ways to write
