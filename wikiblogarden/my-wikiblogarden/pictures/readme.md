# There is too much text on my blog 

There is too much text on my blog. Let me write some text about that. 

## No images

There are hardly any images on my blog! Why is that? It's certainly very possible. But there are almost none.

That's entirely because of how I go about writing my blog posts. I do 99% of them [on my phone](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/art/never-stop-writing/on-your-phone), in my [notes app](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/my-wikiblogarden/demo). And I can't add inline images in my notes app. Isn't that kinda stupid? It would be a very helpful thing to do. 

But even if I could, I'd need to upload them to my blog somehow. And I don't know how I'd go about doing that smoothly.

It's sometimes stunning to see how such a simple basic boring thing can be so hard. It doesn't feel like it's for any good reason. It feels arbitrary.

## "Just use a blogging tool"

All for some bleeding images? All that for an image? And get locked in to a platform or framework or system? All that? No! 

## "Just build a build system"

Wait how does that make my life easier? That doesn't even solve any of my problems. Did you even listen to the thing I'm trying to do? 

## "Just use/build a CMS"

[I don't know what CMS means.](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/academia/style/never/use/acronyms/)

## "Just use/build a content management system"

WHICH ONE, wise guy? One that I can use from my phone? That isn't a pain in the arse? That doesn't need a huge setup and swap over? I didn't think so. 

## Feeling the pain

Sometimes it's good to feel the pain of a problem, I think. It builds my hunger to fix it. And one day I will fix it, without any [more ideas](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/my-wikiblogarden/no-more-ideas) or [more tools](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/better-computing/worse-computing/no-more-tools) at all.
