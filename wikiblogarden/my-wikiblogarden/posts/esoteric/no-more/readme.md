# No more esoteric posts

I've decided to stop writing esoteric posts.

## Esoteric posts

Recently I've written quite a [few](/wikiblogarden/men/) [esoteric](/wikiblogarden/better-computing/worse-computing/no-more-tools/) [posts](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/men/no/not/like/that/). And it's time to stop!

We're all here to discuss tech, and coding, and tech. We've had enough of this esoteric crap.

Thank you and good day.
