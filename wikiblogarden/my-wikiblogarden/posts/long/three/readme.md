# Three long posts

I'm usually writing two to three blog posts at any given time.

Usually there's a mix of longer and shorter posts, so that I can keep up my cadence. Right now, I'm working on these three:

1. RIBBIT REPORT: Normalising scrappy fiddles
2. TODEPOND PONDCAST: Pointing to the pieces
3. Repetition

Unfortunately, all three of them are very long. (It's taking too long). (It's taking too-oooo long).
