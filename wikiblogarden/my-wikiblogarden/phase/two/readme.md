In some ways, I've grown to hate [my wikiblogarden](/wikiblogarden).

<hr>

This blog has been a magnet pole for so much of my creative energy that would have normally ended up getting sucked into [my videos](https://youtube.com/@todepond) instead. 

And I consi—

And that's not a good thing. Because a blog post is a much worse fate for a creative feeling to meet. Text is [really limited](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/art/voice/finding/words/) and misses so much nuance, or at least I'm not yet skilled enough to use it in the way I want, nor do I want to be. It's not—

<hr>

This wiki disgusts me, in all honesty. It's—

There's far too much *order* and not enough chaos. Everything follows "the rules".

1. There's always a title.
2. Then a little tagline.
3. Then some little sections with titles too.
4. Then some "blending" section that blends things together at the end.
5. Then "back to the [wikiblogarden](/wikiblogarden)".

And there's the growing style guide of little quirks that you might start to notice if you read a lot: 

1. Use dashes to— dashes can be used to indicate— in place of backspaces. But the resultant "sentence" must not make sense. 
2. Use colons liberally: No one can stop you: You're an adult. 
3. Repetition is fine and also it's fine.
4. You can use slashes to use/pick more than one word at the same time/place. This one actually predates the wikiblogarden. It originally comes from the todepond [pondcast/times](/pondcast).
5. The first time I say [just](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/better-computing/just/)—
6. Footnotes[^foot] can be used liberally for comment[^comment] or reference[^ref].

And here I am again, just going through an orderly list again.

One of the things I hate about text as a medium is how calming it can be.

I hate my wikiblogarden. So the question is: What now? 

Do I destroy it? Do I shut it down? Do I take a break? 

No!
