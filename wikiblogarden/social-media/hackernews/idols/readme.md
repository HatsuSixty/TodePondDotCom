# Stop worshipping tech idols

Will nobody call out the tech idol worship?

No? 

No? 

No? 

## Stop worshipping tech idols

We should all have role models, that's for sure. I've been fortunate enough to have many during my time so far.

But wait, a role model isn't the same as an idol. A role model is someone you look up to, that you respect, that you learn from. But an idol...........

An idol is someone you worship, that can do no wrong, that you trust as the voice of truth and good above all else, that you protect, that you love.

Maybe someone can be your role model and your idol at the same time. Either way, I would argue that one is a healthy relationship to have, and one is not. 

*Shall we look at some examples?*

## Mark Zuckerberg

Some people love Mark Zuckerberg, and increasingly so since his branding team got to work on him. But don't forget his roots. Mark Zuckerberg is a psychopath you "dumb fuck" ([his words](https://www.businessinsider.com/well-these-new-zuckerberg-ims-wont-help-facebooks-privacy-problems-2010-5) not mine).

## Jonathan Blow

Some people worship Jonathan Blow as god of programming and high speed code efficiency extraordinaire. He also holds the belief that women are less interested in tech due to [biological differences](https://x.com/hEnereyG/status/942651723998420993).

## Garry Tan

Oh no, really? [Really](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39223766)?

## Marc Andreessen

I already did this [one](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/better-computing/worse-computing/e-acc).

## Sam Altman

Sammy can't do no wrong... [can he](https://x.com/BasedBeffJezos/status/1781968122049888620)? [can he](https://www.themarysue.com/annie-altmans-abuse-allegations-against-openais-sam-altman-highlight-the-need-to-prioritize-humanity-over-tech/)?

## Steve Jobs

Nice demos, [lacking elsewhere](https://nypost.com/2018/09/06/steve-jobs-exposed-as-an-abusive-creep-by-his-daughter/).

## Jeff Bezos

[No](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos#Criticism).

## Bret Victor

Leave Bret alone!

## Dan Abramov

Leave Dan alone too! 

## All the streamers

Too many to list.

## They're usually white guys

What do all these people have in common? Well, they're all well-off, they're all in positions of power, and they're all men.

Take it or leave it.
