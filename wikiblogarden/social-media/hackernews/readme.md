# Hackernews is a vile website

It doesn't need saying, right?

## It works great

It works great. The buttons do what you want. It's easy to use.

The design is old-fashioned. It's so old-fashioned that it's almost *back in fashion*. I like how brutalist it is.

## The people are awful

They're dripping with disdain. No empathy at all.

Every comment is a 'gotcha' or attempt at sounding smart.

The only good ones are from passing visitors.

## Everyone thinks it

Ok, not everyone. But like 95% of people. Even the ones that use it regularly tell me:

> *"It's a vile website, but I just use it as a news feed.*"

If you disagree, then I've got some news for you.

## Hackernews is a vile website

I feel like something so obvious should be ok to say. Are people scared of pissing off YC or something?
