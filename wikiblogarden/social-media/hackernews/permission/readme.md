# You have my explicit permission to post my stuff to hackernews

As we've [previously discussed](/wikiblogarden/social-media/hackernews), Hackernews is a vile website.

It's full of awful people.

That's exactly why you should post my stuff there.

## I can fix him

I don't want to preach to the choir. I want to reach the people that disagree with me most.

Every now and then, or once in a blue moon, I might be able to convince someone to change their mind. Maybe I'll persuade one in a thousand people. It's worth the effort!

## Post my stuff

Please help!

Post my stuff to hackernews, twitter, linkedin, and all the other vile places too. Help me reach the people that are harder to reach.
