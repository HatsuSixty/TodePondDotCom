# Matt Webb answered all my questions

I had some unanswered questions.

- What is RSS?
- What is a memex?

[Matt Webb](https://interconnected.org/home/) answered them all.

## RSS

[RSS](/wikiblogarden/social-media/what-is-rss) stands for Really Simple Something, which is a lie. As Matt says on [his website](https://aboutfeeds.com/why), it can be complicated.

It's a *feed*, kind of like how twitter or facebook or [mastodon](https://elk.zone/mas.to/@TodePond) is a feed. Except... this feed is owned by **you**. It's a sliding scale for sure. But RSS is at the end.

> Well, it's more like [a blog](/wikiblogarden/my-wikiblogarden) really.

You craft your feed by subscribing to other feeds (?). You can see them all in [a feed-reader](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nononsenseapps.feeder.play). But if that's too weird for you, you can also just [read them online](https://nonnullish.pages.dev/feed.xml). Most people style them so they look nice - just like normal websites.

## What is a memex?

This is way too big for me to answer right now. Matt gave me a whistle-stop-tour of some of the lectures he gives at a local university - about the history of the computer/internet.

A memex is an early idea for a computer. It was in the shape of a desk, because they were obsessed with furniture back then.

It had two screens because it was all about **connecting** information together. You'd put the same information in two places, so you'd need to see those two places at the same time. Hence the two screens.

Maybe there's a paragraph of text that appears in two different places. This **text** is **linked** with another place through **hyperspace**.

*Almost like **hypertext**???????*

*Or a **hyperlink**!!!!!!!!!*

Crazy times.

## Other people

Loads of other people answered my questions too. From their answers, I learned even more! I'll save that for another wikiblog post.

Thank you to everyone out there for being so helpful.

## What's next?

The nice thing about getting your questions answered is that it gives you even more questions.

I'll be posting more of them here on my [feed](/feed), and on [mastodon](https://elk.zone/mas.to/@TodePond)!
