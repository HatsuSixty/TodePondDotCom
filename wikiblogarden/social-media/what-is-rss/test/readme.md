# This is a test

This post is entirely a test of my new RSS feed.

## Does it work?

Did this pop up in your reader?

If it did, please let me know! My contact details are on [todepond dot com](/).

## Do I need to use a reader?

No! You can see my feed at [todepond dot com slash feed](/feed).

## What's next?

I have some other improvements incoming.

- [ ] Show the whole post in the feed, not just a link.
- [ ] Don't rely on javascript to render [my feed](/feed/). Can probably just use styled xml or something.
- [ ] Make my internal tooling [local-first](/wikiblogarden/better-computing/).
