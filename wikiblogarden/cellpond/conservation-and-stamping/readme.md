# Conservation and stamping

- What is the "conservation" part that I talk about in [this post](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/cellpond/the-weirdest-thing/)?
- What is conserved?
- Why is stamping weird?
- What was the mainstream thinking before?

## Conservation

The 'conservation' is the conservation of cell colours from the LHS (left-hand-side) to the RHS (right-hand-side) of the diagram. I hoped I explained it in that post, but I've always found it a tricky one, so let me know if there's anything in particular that I lost you on ðŸ˜…

eg: Look at this rule.

^ it means:

When green or blue is above black...<br>
Then replace it with green or blue below black.

Here it is in action.
