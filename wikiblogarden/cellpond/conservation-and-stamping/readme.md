# Conservation and stamping

- What is the "conservation" part that I talk about in [this post](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/cellpond/the-weirdest-thing/)?
- What is conserved?
- Why is stamping weird?
- What was the mainstream thinking before?

## Conservation

The 'conservation' is the conservation of cell colours from the LHS (left-hand-side) to the RHS (right-hand-side) of the diagram. I hoped I explained it in that post, but I've always found it a tricky one, so let me know if there's anything in particular that I lost you on üòÖ

eg: Look at this rule.

^ it means:

When green or blue is above black...<br>
Then replace it with green or blue below black.

Here it is in action.

Notice how green falls as green. Blue falls as blue.<br>
The colour of the falling cell has been 'conserved'.<br>
That's what conservation is.

## Stamping

You can stamp a cell like this:<br>
(Ignore the visual bug - the square hole should also cover the green half)

It overrides cellpond's natural in-built conservation.<br>
It makes the 'replacement' randomly pick between green and blue, instead of using what's already there:

It's weird because nothing like it has been done in this space before.<br>
And when I told it to some people who do work in the space, they found it weird. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Ok, I should really get back to work now. I'll continue this some other time :)
