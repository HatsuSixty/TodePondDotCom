# Cellpond

I made a thing called cellpond. It's an experimental cellular automata that you can code with a drag & drop programming language.

Try it at [cellpond.cool](https://cellpond.cool) or see the code in its [repo](https://github.com/todepond/cellpond).

I've also made a bunch of things about it! They're listed below.
