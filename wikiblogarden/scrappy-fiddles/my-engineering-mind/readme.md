# My Engineering mind

A book of poems about normalising sharing scrappy fiddles.

## Olive amphibian dot mp4

> Before I try arroost<br>
> here are my first impressions<br>
> of olive amphibian<br>
> dot mp4

## Yawn

> I hear lots<br>
> of boring<br>
> robotic<br>
> repetition <br>
> yawn

## Didn't use arroost

> I hear your voice<br>
> add some<br>
> vibrato
>
> Which makes the vocal<br>
> part more<br>
> interesting
>
> And that addition<br>
> of vibrato<br>
> didn’t use arroost

## Just about everything

> Your vocals remind me<br>
> of David Sylvian’s voice<br>
> on “God’s monkey”<br>
> and just about everything<br>
> on “The first day”

## Perfect!

> I hear perfect rhymes<br>
> “down”<br>
> and “clown”<br>
> yawn

## Eff why eye

> Eff why eye<br>
> what I think<br>
> I learned about<br>
> songwriting:

## On many levels

> Any artform<br>
> songs, movies, books<br>
> et cetera<br>
> needs to create<br>
> tension
>
> Then maybe<br>
> to resolve the tension
>
> Like playing a<br>
> dee sus four chord<br>
> followed by a dee chord 
>
> You can create tension<br>
> on<br>
> many<br>
> levels<br>
> ee jee melody<br>
> chords<br>
> lyrics, phrasing, song structure<br>
> AABB versus<br>
> ABBA versus<br>
> line lengths, numbers of bars, rhyming<br>
> et cetera<br>
> et cetera<br>
>
> A great song<br>
> a great work of art<br>
> creates tension and release<br>
> on<br>
> many<br>
> levels

## Hidden things

> You can<br>
> keep coming back to it
>
> and hear<br>
> new things every time
>
> Not just<br>
> in repeated listens
>
> but on<br>
> a time-scale of decades

## Lack of nuance

> Simplicity is<br>
> “lack of nuance”

## Lack of nuance, part two

> Hence complexity<br>
> “contains nuance”

## Average art

> Great works of art<br>
> appear to be simple<br>
> but have subtle nuance<br>
> that can be gleaned<br>
> by repeated study<br>
> eye ee layered
>
> Average art is either<br>
> simple or nuanced<br>
> but not both
>
> Flat not layered

## Imply imbalance

> From a lyric perspective
>
> Perfect rhymes<br>
> imply perfect balance<br>
> closure and “happiness
>
> Imperfect rhymes<br>
> imply imbalance<br>
> and

## Et cetera

> Sadness<br>
> confusion<br>
> longing<br>
> et cetera

## Rhyme zone dot com

> For perfect rhymes<br>
> I use rhyme zone dot com
>
> For imperfect rhymes<br>
> I use bee rhymes dot com<br>
> My goto is bee rhymes dot com
>
> It gives me 100 possibilities<br>
> and causes my mind to wander<br>
> brainstorming

## That theme

> The music that you’ve<br>
> created with arroost<br>
> is unstable
>
> and eye em oh<br>
> perfect rhymes don’t fit in with that<br>
> theme

## My Engineering mind with a capital E

> I always loved<br>
> McCartney’s song<br>
> “Yesterday”
>
> I tried for decades<br>
> but could never play it<br>
> and sing it
>
> Then someone<br>
> Pat Pattison<br>
> pointed out to me<br>
> 
> That the verse has only<br>
> seven bars<br>
> not eight 
>
> My Engineering mind<br>
> tried to force<br>
> singing the song<br>
>
> As if it had eight bars
>
> Seven bars makes the song sound sadder<br>
> and prevents Engineers<br>
> like me<br>
> from cloning it
