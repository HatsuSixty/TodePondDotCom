# My Engineering mind

A book of poems about normalising sharing scrappy fiddles.

## Olive amphibian dot mp4

> Before I try arroost<br>
> here are my first impressions<br>
> of olive amphibian<br>
> dot mp4

## Yawn

> I hear lots<br>
> of boring<br>
> robotic<br>
> repetition <br>
> yawn

## Didn't use arroost

> I hear your voice<br>
> add some vibrato
>
> Which makes the vocal part<br>
> more interesting
>
> And that addition<br>
> of vibrato<br>
> didn’t use arroost

## Just about everything

> Your vocals remind me of<br>
> David Sylvian’s voice on<br>
> God’s monkey and<br>
> just about everything on<br>
> The first day

## Perfect

> I hear perfect rhymes<br>
> down<br>
> and clown<br>
> yawn

## Eff why eye

> Eff why eye<br>
> what I think<br>
> I learned about<br>
> songwriting:

## On many levels

> Any artform<br>
> songs, movies, books<br>
> et cetera<br>
> needs to create<br>
> tension
>
> Then maybe<br>
> to resolve the tension
>
> Like playing a<br>
> dee sus four chord<br>
> followed by a dee chord 
>
> You can create tension<br>
> on<br>
> many<br>
> levels<br>
> ee jee melody<br>
> chords<br>
> lyrics, phrasing, song structure<br>
> AABB versus<br>
> ABBA versus<br>
> line lengths, numbers of bars, rhyming<br>
> et cetera<br>
> et cetera<br>
>
> A great song<br>
> a great work of art<br>
> creates tension and release<br>
> on<br>
> many<br>
> levels

## Hidden things

> You can keep coming back to it
> Hear new things every time
> Not just in repeated listens
> But on a time-scale of decades

## Lack of nuance

> Simplicity is<br>
> lack of nuance

## Lack of nuance, part two

> Hence complexity<br>
> contains nuance

## Average art

> Great works of art<br>
> appear to be simple<br>
> but have subtle nuance<br>
> that can be gleaned<br>
> by repeated study<br>
> eye ee layered
>
> Average art is either<br>
> simple or nuanced<br>
> but not both
>
> Flat not layered

## Imply imbalance

> From a lyric perspective
>
> Perfect rhymes<br>
> imply perfect balance<br>
> closure and happiness
>
> Imperfect rhymes<br>
> imply imbalance<br>
> and

## Et cetera

> Sadness<br>
> confusion<br>
> longing<br>
> et cetera

## Rhyme zone dot com

> For perfect rhymes<br>
> I use rhyme zone dot com
>
> For imperfect rhymes<br>
> I use bee rhymes dot com<br>
> My goto is bee rhymes dot com
>
> It gives me 100 possibilities<br>
> and causes my mind to wander<br>
> brainstorming

## That theme

> The music that you’ve created<br>
> with arroost<br>
> is unstable
>
> And eye em oh<br>
> perfect rhymes don’t fit in with that<br>
> theme

## My Engineering mind with a capital E

> I always loved<br>
> McCartney’s song<br>
> Yesterday
>
> I tried for decades<br>
> but could never play it<br>
> and sing it
>
> Then someone<br>
> Pat Pattison<br>
> pointed out to me<br>
> 
> That the verse has only<br>
> seven bars<br>
> not eight 
>
> My Engineering mind<br>
> tried to force<br>
> singing the song<br>
>
> As if it had eight bars
>
> Seven bars makes the song sound sadder<br>
> and prevents Engineers<br>
> like me<br>
> from cloning it
