# I went to an algorave

I went to an [algorave](https://algorave.com/) and it changed me forever.

## Creativity

I've been making— I've made—

I've been trying to express myself with code for [a while](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9uRa69RF-7wastqKWXT4d9F84BAzfVd4&si=FGQYcdRK3h2mM8DS).

I build tools for myself that let me— allow me to be creative— to express myself. It started with [sandpond](https://sandpond.cool) and it led to [arroost](https://arroost.com) and the [tadi web](https://tadiweb.com) and [torn leaf](https://tornleaf.gallery) and [other stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlsDbXSZ2ko) and it might lead me to more, who knows.

I feel like— I've struggled and learned— I've struggled through various— I've learned some—

It hasn't always been easy for me to express myself with code. I have found myself struggling through the same hurdles and blockers again and again. And in doing that, I learn things —about myself, and also about the practice of being creative more generally— in a more general sense.

Through this struggle, I have seen myself change throughout— as my situation changes around me. I now sound different, and I look different, and I act different, and I still don't know what I want or who I am, but I am learning to—

I have always hoped that I— I always thought that if I—

"If I [just] figure out how to express myself fully, then I'll finally know who I am."

I'll be at peace! I'll reach the end. So I have been very motivated to make things— new things, and express myself with new [ideas]. And get to the end. "Just make [99 sands]! (in different ways)" (in different ways) (in different ways) (in different—

## Normalise sharing scrappy fiddles

At some point, I started to realise that I was very wrong.

It wasn't the "finishing" that was important on that creative journey. It was— the journey part of— the journey of the journey was the most important part of the journey. It's a process— creativity is a process that we go through— that feels like change.

Through making things— expressing myself, I change. My change is reflected in my work. It has a moving target and it never quite gets there. And my work bounces back at me, and it changes me in return. I learn— I mean— I'm inspired by— it makes me realise— helps me— you know what I mean— it's a two way street— it goes back and forth like a `dialogue`.

If you ever do— ever get to the end of an artistic project, you end up with an **artifact**. But that artifact is not the project and the project is not the artifact. The artifact is only the final step— a shadowy echo of what you _really did_. It can be important— meaningful, but only within the bigger picture within your struggle towards the `end`. If you were to discard all of that initial work, you would lose something valuable— something precious.

The process is the point! That's the human part! That's why we're here! To share our journeys and struggles with each other! Otherwise we're no better— we're no better than some stupid— if you want an artifact— without the process we are nothing better than a stupid image or language model pumping out— regurgitating any— if you want an artifact— but that's not why we're—

## Normalise sharing scrappy fiddles

I realised that it's important to share the imperfect _process_ behind creation, even if it sucks, because it's the most important bit. And you see me doing that here with these dashes that I— that indicate where I have changed my mind. I don't backspace, I dash instead. And so you can see my— see how my— you can see my process and my struggle towards the `end`. You can know when I'm sure, and you can know when I'm uncertain— when I can't write— decide what to say— write. And hopefully, you can see inside my head a little bit. And we can feel closer. And we can feel—

I call it `"normalise sharing scrappy fiddles"`. Don't just share the `end`. Don't just share the artifact. Share the whole process, from start to finish, and beyond (in each direction).

I have been trying to get people to `normalise sharing scrappy fiddles` for a while now, on my [mastodon] and in my— my [talks] and on— and on my [blog] and in my [appearances]— [appearances].

And what's more—

<br>

I think that it's morally important— important, in a moral sense to— that we normalise sharing scrappy fiddles. I think that it's morally wrong to _not_ normalise sharing scrappy fiddles— that `not normalising sharing scrappy fiddles` is morally wrong— inaction is morally wrong. I want you to know that this is how important it is to me.

## Arroost

My quest towards `normalising sharing scrappy fiddles` led me to create a [tool] called arrow— roost— [arroost]. Arroost has many influences— too many influences to list. I will now list— let me list some of my— here are some of my favourites.

- [Maywa Denki]
- [Toshio Iwai](https://www.youtube.com/live/t8cI6GlyKqk?si=mxfCmWDIN10ginxP)
- [Sandspiel]
- [tldraw]
- [Kid Pix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kid_Pix)

Arroost helps you create— express yourself through music because it's really complicated— opaque and difficult to use. Its interface kinda sucks, and it isn't clear what to do and its really hard to get all the timing right and it has this stupid time travel thing going on and it tricks you into thinking that that's the main thing but it's not the main thing— the main thing is that you can make sounds in it and when you hear those sounds coming back to you it sounds— it feels like those sounds don't come from you really— it feels like those sounds come from arroost.

So it takes responsibility away from you. You stop worrying about what your music sounds like because it isn't yours. It belongs to arroost. But you still made it. The artifact is lost— it crashes often— your work gets— is lost when you close the window and that's the— the whole point is that you're here to `make some sounds` not to `have made some sounds`.

You're not supposed to use arroost forever. You're supposed to use arroost and let it `change` you— let it—

A lovely guy called [Shane] wrote about it in his [blog post](https://edibotopic.com/blog/doing/leisure-sick/). He said that it— and I _directly quote_:

> "Arroost got me back to a place where I could make something"

Shane gives various reasons for this in the blog post. One of these is:

> "With Arroost I couldn't do noise reduction, so I stopped caring and just focused on recording."

And I was really pleased to see all the `scrappy fiddles` that people made in arroost, and more importantly, `shared`. Click [here] for just a small selection of examples.

This is not unique to arroost. You can see a similar thing happening in all my influences too. [tldraw] creatively frees you to draw because of its— the imperfections of its marks. [Sandspiel] is not a drawing tool, which makes it a great drawing tool. [Nonsense machines] are hard to play, which makes them easy to play.

## Live coding

I didn't set out to make a [live coding] tool, but I guess I— I did. I think that live coding is when you code some music or visuals or whatever, live— I mean— live coding is when you perform— give a performance— perform— play— create by coding on the spot.

And I felt kinda bad about this to be honest. Cos I made a live coding tool without knowing anything about the live coding community. But some people pointed out to me— some people from the live coding world pointed out to me that arroost was basically a live coding tool. This happened after I did a live performance of arroost, entitled [normalise sharing scrappy fiddles].

There were people at that event who told me this— that arroost is live coding, and they invited me to come along to their live coding meetups. They were very welcoming. I told them that I didn't know anything about live coding and they told me that it doesn't matter.

<br>

Time passed, and through bad luck and nothing else, I wasn't able to get to any of those live coding meetups. It was just some unfortunate timing, that's all. But still, people like [Joana Chicao] kept encouraging me to come along, which was very nice.

My other exposure to the live coding world was through [Alex McLean], first on the [future of coding slack] and then on [mastodon] and [elsewhere]. I tried to learn as much as I could about live coding, so that I could understand what I was building more and more— or— what kind of context I was building within— what kind of community I was part of.

I learned about [Laurie Spiegel] and [Algorave] and how live coding gets sometimes squeezed out of more "serious" (read: stupid) academic spaces for stupid reasons. And I reflected back on [Xavier's talk] at last year's [LIVE], and how it would be great to see more like that.

And in my head, I started to connect my different influences together. [Electroplankton] is a form of live coding. What about [sushi go]? What about [otomatone]? And [nonsense machines]? I think they can be meaningfully viewed as live coding.

What about [sandspiel studio]? What about giving a [live demo]? How far can it be pushed beyond its usual characteristics? Is there room for what I do in all of this? [Apparently](https://youtu.be/-QY2x6aZzqc?si=Wu-QQVxV8jreUiPP):

> "People are pushing the boundary of what live coding is all the time. It's kind of live coding itself, in a way."

But I still felt like I didn't really understand. I was learning about it— I wasn't experiencing it or joining in.

## Blending

All the while, I was grappling with my place in wider communities— fields. [All around me], I felt the pressure to specialise. Do I go down the research path? or art? or engineering? or content? or—

And I have been struggling towards bringing my work in these fields closer together.

what was I gonna say here—

oh yeah—

I sometimes struggle to "find my people" in a way. I enjoy— relate to different parts— aspects of different communities. And I find myself taking part in lots of different ones, but feeling home in none. This is not unique to me— this is not rare. Quite the opposite, in fact. In fact, I'm pretty sure this is the most common experience that people experience— and you might relate to— experience it yourself.

So I find myself trying to build my own path out of the component pieces that I have access to. I don't want to hop between doing art and content and research and— I want it to be the same thing. I want it to be [blended], just like [me], so I try to carve myself a blended field where I can keep one foot in all worlds.

You are welcome to judge how well I am doing at my task, but I think it's going ok so far. People seem to _mostly_ like what I make, but then they also continually tell me to do things [differently]— that I'm doing things [wrong]— that I should do things more like _them_ and _their field_, and not like _all those other fields_. And so I do wonder sometimes what it is I am doing wrong— what I should do instead— what I should change. I have my doubts in myself sometimes, just like everybody.

Sometimes I wonder— what would it feel like— just for one moment— for someone— just one person— to tell me—

"Just go for it lu"

"Go all the way"

<br>

<br>

<br>

Fortunately, I'm a very very very very very very very very very very— very very very very very very stubborn person. It's mainly a learned response— some kind of survival instinct— I strongly resist [external calls for me to change].

## Activism

I went on a [march] recently.

In one of the speeches, the speaker, [Nadeem Perera] said that "everyone does activism in their own way"— everyone is an activist in their own way. We all have our strengths and weaknesses, and that's ok. By working together, and embracing our diversity of approaches, we are all the better for it.

The march itself was special because it was a combined efforts of different groups that normally don't work together. Direct action groups like [Extinction Rebellion] and [Just Stop Oil] teamed up with more traditional organisations like [WWF] and [The Wildlife Trusts], also known as "the old guard".

Leading up to the event, there were [small signs] of discomfort around this. Do these large corporate charities really want their name next to radical and disruptive groups? Do these radical and disruptive groups really want their name next to large corporate charities?

The answer, of course— is yes, of course. Of course they want to be blended— it benefits everyone— brings legitimacy to both ends of the spectrum— they cover for each other.

Because of this blending, the march felt special— felt like the coming together of different fields. And it made me think about my own— it made me think about what I do. I might not fit into certain characterisations of activism, or research, or—

I don't go on a lot of marches— protests, but I do occasionally ask people to [do something] and— I do try to normalise— —whatever it is that I [am]. And [very occasionally]— it very occasionally [works].

I haven't thought about it as "activism" as such. Maybe "satire", but definitely not "activism", but now I'm questioning that.

What would it look like if I fully embrace my style— if I "go all the way" with what I do— go further than I have before, and advocate for myself and others, while also combining it— blending it with everything else? Art, comedy, satire, content, research, activism, community. What would it look like for me to fully embrace that? and "go all the way"?

## Building community

Meanwhile, I was asking every researcher I could find— I was asking the same question to every researcher I could find.

> "Is your work about influencing people? or solving hard problems?"

I wrote it up in my [write up], but I found most answers unsatisfying. The one that impacted me most was [Alex McLean]'s [reply](https://post.lurk.org/@yaxu/112586629282774766) on mastodon afterwards (remember him from earlier?).

He says the important thing is:

> "making space for community, and getting the conditions right so the community then grows itself. I think to really align with this approach it's good to stop talking about making tools for people. I think tools are much more limited than languages or environments."

[NO MORE TOOLS]

oh no—

all I do is make tools—

like arroost—

well that's mostly what I do—

not always but—

Ok that's not only what I do. [Torn leaf] has been one of the most creatively fulfilling projects for me recently, and its [first artifact] isn't even finished yet. I put out a call for logo submissions— a call— invitation for people to recreate the torn leaf logo in whatever way they want. "It can be good. It can be bad."

I was expecting maybe a handful of submissions— five or ten max, but it went relatively viral. Hundreds of people sent me their— sent in their logos. It totally swamped me. But it was lovely— overwhelmingly lovely to see all the submissions that people had made in all these different ways. It felt like a "community moment"— some collaborative creation— expression of something (or other). I felt a sense of belonging. If you knew what torn leaf was— if you knew the meme— the phrases— that "you must submit something to torn leaf"— was the symbol—

"The [tadi web] [doesn't belong to me]" is what I tell people. I'm not in charge of it— I don't control it. I only described— observed it— its possibility to exist— of existing. And people have started to run with it. I see it popping up in [more] and [more] places. It is lovely to see that happening, all without me.

The goal of the tadi web— torn leaf— is the same as the tadi web— torn leaf. Its goal is to blend together communities and bring them together. And one day, the two umbrellas may come together and blend as one— reducing down to one torni weaf— tan leb. Two copies of the same thing— _the same thing repeated, but slightly changed_.

And so I wonder if I should make less [arroosts] and less [sandponds] and more tarni leebs.

## London coding scene

The [London coding scene] is a mixture of many blended communities. I mean— I've been through this before— I won't go through it again. Let me just pick out a few moments.

My first introduction to the London coding scene was through [Sam Wray], who somehow found my [early youtube videos] that were only picking up ten to twenty views each. He told me that I should come along to [London Creative Coding] meetups. Unfortunately, this was during lockdown, so I couldn't go to anything in-person. But I did join the remote meetups and it made my head start to explode with possibilities. I became inspired by people like [Jazmin Morris] and [Cassie Evans] and it was complete news to me that there was a whole world of people expressing— making things with code.

Time passed, and it— it's gone full circle. I was a [speaker] at one of the in-person [events]. And now, I'm one of the people running the thing. I don't do much— I do very little compared to the others in the group— I'm not very helpful at all. But I was really happy to invite two of the speakers for the next event, [V Buckenham] and [Joana Chicao].

I know both of them through the [Future of Coding] meetups here in London. I've seen them both give great talks there. V shared [Downpour], their app that lets people make and share scrappy games [on their phone]. And Joana shared some of her practice around [choreography] in the context of computing. She worked within the web browser, injecting her code into familiar websites, like Google(!), adding her own sounds and behaviour into the experience. Both talks felt rebellious— punk, in some sense. They felt cheeky— there's a sense of humour to them.

And I discovered the Future of Coding through [Steve Ruiz], my current boss. Steve is known for his "build in public" style, that he has shared on twitter for a long time. And no one does it as well as Steve— to the extent that Steve does it (except maybe me 🫣). It's `normalise sharing scrappy fiddles` through and through, whether you [label it that or not]. It's sharing the process and sharing it live. It's why Steve first reached out to me. He saw me doing the [same].

`Time passed, and it— it's gone full circle.` I've spoken at three [future] [of] [coding] events now, and I'm co-host of the podcast(!) and one of the other hosts makes the music for my youtube videos and it goes really well with the animations that my partner [Flora Caulton] makes for them.

And of course, I [work] at [tldraw] now, Steve's company. Things have blended together.

My work at tldraw continues to be about making things and sharing the process, live— in [realtime], with my colleague [Orion Reed]. This is the practice that the company grew from, and because of that, it stands as an outlier in the tech world. And now I'm getting asked onto [podcasts] and [things] to talk about that approach.

Normalise sharing scrappy fiddles.

I am proud that tldraw has been able to support the London coding scene in small ways, sponsoring and paying for events like Future of Coding, and London Creative Coding. And more recently, we hosted [QueerJS] in our office, organised by my colleague [Akex Dytrych].

I spoke at QueerJS, and so did my colleague, [Taha Hassan], who shared some extremely early stage work on improving the accessibility of the canvas. His talk contained scrappy demos, as well as his early design and planning work. He shared his whole process— he shared it all, and it was fantastic.

In _all_ of these events, there is a culture of scrappy process sharing. [Maggie Appleton] has put in monumental effort and leadership in creating that culture at London's [Future of Coding] meetups. The emphasis is on the scrappy "seven minute demo", which she has written about on _her_ [wikiblogarden](https://maggieappleton.com/gathering-structures). You should read it.

London is great because it's a [convergence point]. People travel here from elsewhere. People stop off here while passing through. They are all part of the scene, even if they don't live here. Like [Alex McLean] a few weeks ago. He popped a message up on the Live Code London chat.

> "I'm in London this evening if anyone fancies a swift half"

So me and my colleague [Orion Reed] joined him for a swift four halves after work, and the three of us talked about `all of this`.

## Algorave

I went to an [algorave] and it changed me forever.

It's where live coding happens and people dance to visuals and music.

I saw [Alex McLean] perform (remember him?) and [Joana Chicao] perform (remember her?) and [Sam Wray] perform (remember him?) and [V] was there (remember them?) and [Orion Reed] (remember him?) and [Taha Hassan] (remember him?) and [Flora Caulton] (remember her?) and lots more people who were also at the [QueerJS meetup] (remember that?) and we couldn't quite manage to convince [Alex Dytrych] to come (maybe next time) (remember her?)

[Sam Wray] was there making visuals, and it was great to meet him in person for the first time. We'd only ever called before (and we got the train home with him afterwards).

After seeing [Joana Chicao] talk about choreography in her [Future of Coding] talk, it was great— I was pleased to see her perform it for real. It was hilarious and brilliant. She searched something like "live feed camera" on YouTube(!) and then —she started messing with the website's search results to turn it into live visuals— to make it _dance_. She was the choreographer in this case. She was conducting the algorithmic feed— intended to manipulate— choreograph her, and she flipped it around— flipped around the power imbalance— dynamic.

Suggested videos of cats and cute kittens, and inline adverts, and UI components, buttons and links— they all bounced up and down, grew in and out— they spun around— they glowed with different colours. This is not what Alphabet(!) intended to happen! It felt like graffiti. And it was super scrappy. You could see the browser's console, and you could see what Joana was typing and pasting into it. There was a sense of humour and cheekiness to it.

[Alex McLean] stopped the music midway through his set.

"We're going to do some maths" is what he said (or something like that). And then he broke down what he was doing— how the algorithm was working. He got the audience to join in. And I watched an already engaged audience became even more engaged. And I became engrossed! Our group mainly consisted of people who had never been to an algorave before, and this mathsy pause served to get us all involved. We could start to understand what was going on, and we started to listen out for further patterns in further sets. Multiple people commented that they got way more "into it" after that moment.

I mean— it wasn't just about understanding. It was also about explicitly getting the crowd involved. Algorave is often described as a [back and forth] between the coders and the crowd. This pause was a clear acknowledgement and deepening of that.

At one point, Alex made a mistake. He accidentally made one of the sequences cycle through really quickly— fast. It sounded a little bit jarring, and I saw him smile to himself when it happened. He stopped it shortly afterwards and looked up at the crowd and sheepishly said "sorry", which cut the— it made everyone laugh.

At that moment, I thought back to our chat in the pub, when Alex had told me about the culture of "embracing your mistakes" within live coding. I wondered to myself— I wondered if he had considered— even for a moment— did he feel tempted to keep the mistake in? I'm not sure. Maybe not. Maybe that one was too much. But I bet he could if he really wanted to. And I observe how I— how it's— how it shares similarities to my current approach to writing.

The mistake was embraced. It was a positive moment— a moment of laughter— of shared struggle. Alex had to react and respond to the event, and so did the crowd. Everyone dancing had to make a decision on "what to do"— decide how to respond. It was a— live coding is a shared struggle— a combined— community— collaborative effort.

Live coding is live. It's an "[extreme form of sharing]". It leaves you vulnerable. But you know you have support— that you're not alone.

## Building on the past

"We love repetition" is a repeated tagline of—

That night felt special to—

Algorave so I asked Alex McLean what it means to—

Me but I guess it didn't come out of—

Him and he said—

Out of nowhere but it came from—

> When I was a (failing) student the first time around in the 90s I came up with "[mdma generation, we love repetition]" as a joke while messing around with a synth if I recall correctly and later reappropriated it..<br>
> For me though "algorave generation, we love repetition" as a statement sits in the context of UK university computer music departments around 2010, with their institutionalised electroacoustic music culture where virtuosity is all about the number of genelec speakers in your multichannel array, and where repetition was regarded more or less as pure evil. I don't know whether you've heard of this guy Adorno but for some reason he's taken seriously by music academics despite every quote I've read from him coming across as unhinged.. He reckons repetition is "psychotic and infantile". Believe it or not, these people group together all music that isn't electroacoustic or european classical as 'popular music' and repetition would be a mark of that. I think there's a small world mindset inherent in rejecting repetitive dance music and it doesn't take much imagination to link it to racism, homophobia, classism etc.<br>
> So basically to say "we like repetition" is a kind of rejection of that kind of weirdo performative seriousness that we were talking about in the pub. ;)

That event was built on top of a lot of previous events and a lot of previous work. It came at the `end` of many previous choices and acts in—

My work also has the recurring theme of—

The past and—

Repetition and—

Its connection to—

How it combines with—

The present and how—

Change to connect—

Time passes because of—

The future to—

The fine balance of—

The past—

Chaos and—

Repetition—

Order—

And change.

## Arroost from the perspective of live coding

Arroost is a live coding tool, and it leans into a lot of the same themes and values as— but it also differs in some ways.

Algorave [claims](https://algorave.com/about/) that "Algorave musicians don’t pretend their software is being creative, they take responsibility for the music they make." And this is different to Arroost, which tries to take responsibility away from you.

And Arroost places much more emphasis on `voice`. You have to record all the sounds yourself, with whatever you can, and the easiest thing is often your own voice.

These differences reflect the slightly different goals that Arroost has and—

## Recursion is cheap

"Recursion is cheap" is what some guy said once.

"Recursion is cheap" is the same— as an idea has the same elitist undertones as thinking that "repetition is infantile".

If "recursion is cheap" then being recursive becomes a rebellious act in the same way that repetition is.

And we can challenge the idea by trying it out. Is recursion really so cheap? Maybe it's cheap to imagine it, or to create a pattern that would lead to it, but is it cheap to do it? to live it? to really be it? to carry it out? to execute it?

What does it really feel like— mean to be recursive? Can you comprehend the scale— the horror of the unmeasurable infinity that is recursion? Can you face the endless repetition, really?

Do you know what it feels like to stare at yourself an infinite number of times? Like in [Yayoi Kusama's Infinity Rooms](https://youtu.be/bT7i507OnOw), there is no escape. You are there— you are what you are— with your mistakes and your choices— your history and change.

There is no hiding— you cannot hide— that you are a scrappy fiddle, and always were— and always will be.

So it is up to you—

It is up to you whether you share yourself or not. But whatever _you_ choose to do, you must normalise sharing scrappy fiddles, at the very least for those who want to— or have no choice, like [me].

You are a scrappy fiddle. You are a scrappy fiddle. You must normalise sharing scrappy fiddles.

## TodePond Live

I had an idea for doing a [recursive livestream], where I make a fractal by 'reacting' to myself again and again and again and again and again.

It's a very simple pattern. Repeat the video. Repeat. And speed up until you swallow yourself.

But to carry it out— to perform it, it's quite hard. It takes a very long time, and you have to face what you did earlier on. There is no escaping your past.

It is an act of repetition— recursion, but also an act of change. You can see the change I go through during that time. It is spelled out for you to see. I do the livestream over sunset so you can see the change clearly via the light on my face.

And all I have is my voice. That's all I do. I have to find things to say— find what I have to say. I start by being timid. I'm not warmed up, but over time, I gather courage. I find my voice, and lose it, and find it again, and lose it. It's a moving target. There isn't something to find out— figure out. I'm just existing, and expressing myself, through my changing voice.

I hint towards live coding at the start and the end.

And I talk about the themes of identity, [voice], shame, repetition and struggle. These are the things that make it difficult to `normalise sharing scrappy fiddles`.

And I try to touch on all the blended fields that I want to be part of. The stream is some stupid viral marketing content. It is a massive joke. But as well as being a joke, it is also serious. During the stream, people ask me serious questions about my research, and I answer seriously. And it is also an artistic project— a piece of performance art. And it is also advocacy. I explain the message of advocacy that the original video has. And I use the stream as an event to raise money for that cause. And people gave a lot. And it also satire— a parody of the kind of attention grabbing content we are used to and I am part of.

And it is also about community. I mean—

## Cult

- patrons
- charity
- music
- memes

we went through something together

## Change

face your past
change is certain
rainbow

we change each other

## Forever

Through making things— expressing myself, I change. My change is reflected in my work. It has a moving target and it never quite gets there. And my work bounces back at me, and it changes me in return. I learn— I mean— I'm inspired by— it makes me realise— helps me— you know what I mean— it's a two way street— it goes back and forth like a `dialogue`.

If you ever do— ever get to the end of an artistic project, you end up with an **artifact**. But that artifact is not the project and the project is not the artifact. The artifact is only the final step— a shadowy echo of what you _really did_. It can be important— meaningful, but only within the bigger picture within your struggle towards the `end`. If you were to discard all of that initial work, you would lose something valuable— something precious.

The process is the point! That's the human part! That's why we're here! To share our journeys and struggles with each other! Otherwise we're no better— we're no better than some stupid— if you want an artifact— without the process we are nothing better than a stupid image or language model pumping out— regurgitating any— if you want an artifact— but that's not why we're here. We're here to normalise sharing scrappy fiddles.

I went to an [algorave] and it changed me forever.

Back to the [wikiblogarden](/wikiblogarden).
